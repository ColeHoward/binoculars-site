2:33
about this?" I was like "How about this you keep drinking it and let me put let me put my

2:58
butter Peanut butter flavored tequila Cuz just peanut flavored is like totally different Yeah And every year it kills
3:04
like one person on an airplane Dude it's super funny talking about Mexican people We went down there to tequila for it and
3:10
um to to to to Tequila the city Oh there's there might be a country No
3:16
tequila It's a city Guadalajara is the is just a neighboring city that you fly

into But then you go to tequila and at that place they don't have they don't eat peanut butter Nuh-uh And they don't
3:27
know how to dap either They don't know how to dab you up No dude Mexican people if you do this to them they have no clue
3:33
what you're doing That's crazy They have no idea I'm not saying Mexican-Americans who who
3:39
live here now they probably those are called chos They can probably dab fine But you go down there it's just not a
3:44
thing dude I think the exchange rate gets lost I think if you're coming across that border there's no time to dab People are you know can't they're
3:52
struggling They're getting climbing uphill or up like they're wet The kids haven't slept or whatever I think that's
3:59

4:04
two dudes who are sneaking into a country If these people are and that's all Yeah You're not like

and I like to be be reminded of what goes on I like to sometimes I'll look back and feel like how could I maybe
27:00
have done things a little bit different Um I think you always just want to do a little bit better I think Right And then
27:06
you're like well um how are things evolving like in podcasting or whatever
27:12
job you're in so you want to try to be like on the future of it a little bit 100% So but yeah I think you have a Yeah
27:19
it's like I think when you work for yourself or work with people in a small group you you have to you have to stay
27:24
pretty hands-on Like if you started letting somebody else edit your episodes I have a editor Tom who's great
27:31
but we've worked together for so many years now and we correspond I mean we go through notes and notes and it's a huge
27:38
process and even he if he was left to his own devices he would do a great job on the episode It would be great Maybe
27:44
people wouldn't even know but I would to me it's like I would there's certain
27:49
things I just like him the way I like him and he's great cuz he's like he doesn't have an ego I feel like a lot of
27:56
everyone has egos cuz I mean he's just like a nice gym of a person But when you're corresponding in on something
28:02
creative and I'm giving notes do this do this um it would be really easy to be offended if you're he's a very creative
28:08
guy right you know so it's like if you're a creative person you have your own ideas of how you want things done and he has his own ideas He can provide
28:15
those but then he also doesn't get buttth hurt if I'm saying I don't think that's good Which is I think it's such a rare find Oh I think you're right And I
28:23
think also a big thing is that editors I mean let's give a round of applause for editors dude
28:28
They are cuz people are just yelling at them Yep No one appreciate They're like
28:34
the long snappers of media Oh yeah Oh if you saw an editor across the street and
28:39
you were walking by you'd be like "Oh look at this desperate." Then you just get in your
28:45
car and go and be your husband No that's they are they are they're the um
28:52
icebergs of our planet really kind
28:57
of they're out there by themselves Mhm And yeah they're involved with cold
29:03
water but nobody thinks about them like that Everybody just thinks like they're about to sink a ship
29:09
Think about that being iceberg The only thing they're known for basically is every now and then like somebody sees a
29:16
pale polar bear one of them but really the thing they're known for most is sinking that
29:22
boat Isn't that crazy one thing that can be your whole life can get just into one
29:27
thing one moment Yeah I was thinking about that yesterday Just how one Well this is actually a bad
29:33
example but I was thinking about I was reading an article about um from from a while back cuz it was about Morgan Wong
29:39
He was getting ready for his episode and there's a part in it with uh Pdy and PD at the time was like yo we got to stop
29:46
canceling people He was like vouching for uh Wong He's like we got to start stop cancing people We got to give
29:51
people second chances He was like saying like everything that like probably he hoped he was he probably knew he was
29:56
doing some bad [ __ ] He was like putting it starting to spread the word like we got to make sure we can't just like look
30:02
upon people negatively I was like damn but you do one bad thing He probably did it you
30:07
know a few times or whatever but they that's how people know you probably forever Oh Diddy I would hear some crazy
30:15
stuff dude I would hear like he would have a uh I heard this one story that he like had a buddy of his he would
30:22
send him to like nice restaurants and he would if he saw a pretty girl in the restaurant on a date he would have his
30:28
buddy take a phone FaceTime phone give it to the girl and be like "Hey you
30:34
leave this date right now I'll buy you this and this You get out of here Meet
30:39
me at the or maybe not even sometimes meet up with them but just get them to leave a place So because it was like
30:45
some type of a control thing That's what I heard Do I believe that yes
30:52
That's I mean that's not that crazy I guess But I don't believe you know but I believe a lot of stuff you know Um but
30:59
that's kind of a crazy thing Imagine you're sitting there with your date a guy you don't know who's probably a tough guy Yeah walks up and says "Hey
31:06
you're you have a call." And then it's Diddy Yeah it's Diddy Mhm Right And he's abusing somebody in the background but
31:12
he takes a break from that Allegedly abusing somebody Um and then Yeah He's like "Hey you
31:20
leave." And the guy's trying to escape his room Guy or woman's trying to escape and he [ __ ] throws something at him
31:25
Throws a Grammy at him or whatever right and he's like "Shake your tail feather." And he [ __ ] whips a Grammy
31:31
or an Emmy at the back of the guy's head Guy's bleeding now or whatever But he's
31:37
like "Hey." Okay It just happened to you didn't it no it didn't happen But he's just like "Hey if you I'm going to get
31:42
you a couple Birkin bags if you leave right now." Dude I would leave man Would
31:47
you i don't I don't know They I mean just being at dinner for too long stresses me out I get to do my thing now
31:54
is I'll get to check before the food comes Yeah Because you can stay in the
32:00
restaurant once you pay as long as you want Yeah but you can't leave if you don't pay Yep So I'll be like "Bring the
32:05
check first Bring the check first." I ordered dude Bring the [ __ ] check Sometimes I'll leave then I don't even
32:12
really want to [ __ ] be here I could make a smoothie at home Yeah Get your rocks off Just pay that check Yeah Pay
32:17
that check I'll tip that guy Um are you a good tipper i am You are i think I am
32:23
I like doing it Yeah I feel good about it You know also I make fair you know I
32:28
make good money so it' be it would be weird if I didn't tip good I feel like but yeah I think it's fine I don't
32:34
understand people who aren't at least 20% I feel like that's
32:39
I get I get the argument I guess for people being like well they didn't do anything but at the same time like that's their
32:46
job Yeah You you knew when you went in there you Yeah Like it's kind of on you that they you know you're paying them
32:53
for nothing Um [ __ ] What were we talking about just a second ago greta is this a real
33:00
interview thberg I feel like I'm back on your show Don't say that man Don't say that dude We should make a separate
33:06
episode of Sunday out of this What if you could you cut together a
33:11
bonus episode of Sunday out of this you think yeah easily No easily It'd be [ __ ] really hard But that's what's
33:17
amazing about your show You go in there you sit in there a couple things come up you accuse people of something you make a face or two you don't know if you have
33:24
Bell's paws or if you're asking a question And then and then you send me home You sent somebody home I know Like
33:30
every time you wrap up everyone's like "Yeah cuz I don't shoot it like this I
33:36
don't shoot like a free flowing conversation because I know how it's going to edit So I just like that's a waste of time to
33:42
even do all those uh segways and and middlemen parts of the conversation I skip right to the meat." Yeah It's a
33:48
very awkward conversation Oh it's a good point You do you do skip right to the meat dude Um what do you Yeah Do you
33:54
think Diddy What do you think happened there with Diddy well they said you know with that Diddy thing they said they
34:00
just found um they were spicing the baby oil Did you see that no Bring it up
34:05
Spiced baby oil Diddy spiced baby oil Sean Diddy
34:11
Combs baby oil was allegedly laced with date rape drug The allegations against Shawn
34:19
Diddy he did Combmes continue to mount
34:24
Uh while the rapper has been in jail since September arrest faces charges of sex trafficking In a recent slew of
34:29
filings obtained by E-News one plaintiff identified as Jane Doe in the docs alleges the baby oil found in Comb's
34:35
house was laced with Rohipanol or GHB which often referred to as a date rape drug
34:40
Wow Or also referred to as an orurve if you're going to see rufus to soul Dude
34:46
who that's what I'm saying Who's drinking baby oil nobody They're rubbing it on and it goes into their skin like
34:52
that Gets in their skin Yeah Is that really a thing they stuff can go into your body through your body that I don't
35:00
know buddy Cuz think about all the things that go on your skin Oh totally I
35:05
mean like is my shirt going into my skin yeah in some ways Well they say there's
35:12
some uh they say that cotton used to like it used to be better for our skin and then we started using all these
35:17
synthetic products and that's why a lot of people some people believe that like some of the synthetic products could be
35:23
especially wrapped around your genitalia like your underpants could be causing a lot of issues in the world really like
35:30
causing like autism or like if the anus thing with the anus and the scrotum or
35:35
whatever are getting shorter Is it really i don't know I just listened to Joe Rogan say that the perennium or
35:41
whatever it's called Yes the perennium Great word by you The perennium's getting shorter They need to put some
35:46
[ __ ] Christmas trees out there because the coastline in Louisiana is [ __ ] disappearing and every year they
35:51
come get our Christmas tree dude What do you mean coastline there's a beach in Louisiana I would call it a beach dude I
35:58
never thought about that in my life I never thought there'd be about a beach in Louisiana I'll say this If you put your hair under water down there and
36:04
home it comes up cornrow I'll say that dude Okay You'll have a little crab at the end of it just figuring that [ __ ]
36:10
out bro So it definitely has powers in the water I don't know I don't think
36:16
there's a beach Um look up that Does are underpants uh look up
36:23
non Look up non-cotton underpants um
36:31
causing mental disorder This just says cotton underwear make a
36:37
difference even if it's ugly This is not I don't care about the style brother Never mind This is the worst That was a
36:43
wild ride This is the worst interview I've ever been on No it's not dude Dude keep believing in
36:50
yourself Okay Sorry Doing good You're right We're doing good We just haven't talked about anything important or Yeah
36:55
that's kind of We haven't said anything really of any significance We haven't said anything No we haven't said
37:00
anything No we should be talking about something Um well when you start to think about being like because now that
37:06
you're doing your own thing do you feel like you're more capable to do something new like tell me about something like
37:11
branching out on your own like the fears of it and stuff like that and do you think it would be okay do you think it would fail like did you have any real
37:17
fears about it cuz I think a lot of people uh work with somebody or under an umbrella and then they go out and do
37:22
their own thing Yeah I think well the thing that was how Barcel was set up was Dave is very handsoff So he doesn't um
37:31
tell you what you should be doing when you start doing what you're doing Doesn't talk to you You really just go
37:36
complete non-communication with him 100% of the time What that culture breeds I
37:44
think is like a kind of a entrepreneurial spirit I guess the people who are successful there at
37:50
Bartool because you have to be and they have the resources Obviously they're taking the risk on you um by paying your
37:57
salary because they're going to pay you if your content sucks or if your brand loses the brand deal or whatever Like
38:04
every two weeks you're getting paid So they're taking that chance and obviously if you do well they have the upside But
38:09
um it's really it's a place where I was able to kind gave me the resources but I
38:15
was able to kind of build out you know I started working with Tom who's my editor and we worked together for years developed the camaraderie of my producer
38:22
Kelsey who you've met like we started working together developed camaraderie so we had like my own little business inside of bar stool right so going out
38:29
and doing my own thing really was pretty much exactly the same because I already had my business inside of bar stool
38:35
inside of a bigger business oh yeah but um I would like to do some other stuff out outside of Sunday conversation I
38:42
don't know what I mean how was your movie experience I've heard that it's kind of boring shooting a movie oh yeah
38:48
it's boring Um I like be I like the revolutions I can do on Sunday I can put out one
38:54
Sunday a week and it's a lot of work to get it out once but we can do it and then it's like you move on to the next thing If like you had a stinker you can
39:01
still move on and have a good one the next week Yeah And things happen so fast now too Yeah How I even consume how
39:07
everyone consumes content is like um it's so fast It's like you know in the first couple seconds do I want to keep
39:13
watching this or not and sometimes it's interesting It's like something will peique your interest and sometimes it could be the same thing on the next day and it will not peique your interest but
39:19
then two days later it'll peique your interest again I think it's very fascinating I and I'm sure there's a lot
39:25
of like coding as they're figuring that out Um and they just keep hooking you or finding different ways to hook you It's
39:31
kind of crazy though You'll go down some rabbit holes and with the algorithm and the algorithm can lead you to do some
39:37
crazy stuff like what like want to do crime I'll say it like
39:44
want to do crime because the algorithm is like "Oh yeah I saw you mingling over there You want another hit of that
39:49
[ __ ] smack huh?" Yeah I mean you want another [ __ ] couple of hot doses of [ __ ] Gaza core Charlie Kirk oh you're
39:57
like Jesus Christ Next thing you know Yeah It gets it just gets crazy and then
40:02
you're just choking out your neighbor dude Yeah I I do feel like especially Twitter X especially X feeds me stuff I
40:10
don't want to see Like the algorithm it builds out Just like you're saying if you like do doom scrolling or whatever
40:16
you're on your phone for too long it's not that long before you're seeing stuff you don't I don't relate to it at all
40:22
Yeah Imagine if there's just a wheel somewhere you could spin it But one of the options or 11 out of 14 of the
40:28
options were bankruptcy violence machete attacks racism At least on Instagram if
40:34
you do it for a long time you end up with boobs Yeah If you stay on Instagram for a long time you end up at boobs Oh
40:40
yeah you do Well Twitter you end up as bee holes or whatever and like Christmas bee holes and all that Like like it's
40:48
Christmas Can you do at least two days a year without bee holes on Twitter that
40:54
is I don't know They gota Dude I feel so bad for the kids growing up How much porn you Dude you don't have a choice in
41:01
life if you want to watch right we used to have a choice at least Like you used to have the choice Bike to get it or
41:07

41:13
crime One It should be a crime One kid just came out and said he found his sister on Only Fans and it broke his heart You see that video uhuh Man it's
41:20
pretty sad dude I don't want to show it cuz they're they're children but it's just crazy to see People don't even think about that dude I saw a stat It
41:27

41:34
look it up What percentage of women are on Only Fans i mean that's nuts That's nuts But there's so
41:41
much money And if you I guess if you just want to make money you don't care about anything else in the world besides making money Bad way to live
41:48
About 2% of young women are selling themselves and only fans Go back Go to that Number five Number
41:55

like my wits end My axle just broke on my freaking Cyber Truck No way Yeah I
42:11
park I look dude I was like feels like it's weird turning I go look and the [ __ ] is broken You are This is a bad
42:17
question What is that uh cyber truck axle Oh axle It's like
42:24
uh it is a bra I can't have this guy bring it out this [ __ ] dude Couldn't Is it like this yeah it's like a That's
42:31
what it sounds like Is this yes it's like that It's like a lower joist Are you good like handy stuff huh can you do
42:37
that i could I mean I got pissed immediately when I saw it You know what I'm saying i knew I knew it you know I
42:44
knew that uh I it I knew that that's where it was going to be for the rest of the day Changing Uh-uh Do you ever get
42:52
under a car oh yeah dude Oh I'll tell you this So I used to have a Ford Escort right and this [ __ ] would [ __ ] go
42:58
Dude sometimes it would take off right you'd be in it right this before they had self-driving cars whatever but it
43:03
was just the uh throttle or whatever was just loose or unloose or whatever I
43:08
don't remember what it was Tight or loose And that [ __ ] you'd park it dude It would go like an extra 12 feet after
43:14
you got out that [ __ ] it would just it would do a jolt and rev It had a thing It had like this kind of civil war
43:20
feature or whatever but after you got out sometimes it would um there would be
43:25
a combustion and then it would out of the back uh catalytic converter out of the exhaust pipe So my buddy Bo would
43:32
always go stand back there and then he like pretend like you got shot every time Dude you know that on your I today
43:39
I was coming over to the house on your Google uh maps is your truck Mhm Like it
43:46
shows your house and it shows your truck and it shows you in it Nuh-uh You're on your Google maps Really if you type in
43:52
your address which we won't say We won't say dude You're on there Just
43:59
coming by taking pics Oh what's very scary dude Things get scary these days I saw saw a video of myself the other day is driving Somebody drove alongside
44:06
probably 30 seconds just filming me So yeah it just it's okay but it just you're like it starts to make you super
44:11
paranoid Um how was Bridgestone doing two nights there or two day two shows
44:17
that's that's awesome Or does it feel just like a normal show i just ask cuz it's here in Nashville It felt like a mix I think I I it just been a long year
44:24
so everything almost starts to feel the same sometimes But I was excited that uh
44:29
that a lot of people I knew were going Um I did the shows longer than usual I I
44:35
probably should have tightened it up a little bit but I just wanted to be up there you know i was trying to think of things to thank people or trying to
44:42
localize stuff if I could at certain points Um yeah it just I mean you just couldn't
44:47
even believe you know I remember the first show that I ever went to over there was um who's that guy it's Oh Gwen
44:54
Stefani's husband And um after the show my buddy Eddie was
45:00
filming me and um he's like "You going to play here one day?" And I was like "I'm not playing here dude You're out of
45:06
your mind." And then so he sent me that video about a week ago No way It's pretty cool That is cool It really is
45:13
Yeah I mean just bonkers So I think that was fun I was I thought the shows went pretty good so I was I was glad that
45:18
everybody came out and laugh I was just like yeah you just wanted it to go good because also that's a show you have to see those people around town or you have
45:25
to wonder if everybody you ran into could have been one of those people that was at that show Mhm And so that was one
45:30
part that was really exciting about it man And you're going up against Metallica Oh that's true huh
45:35
Which is pretty good that people's right
45:43
Imagine having opportunity to go see Metallica and choosing to go see you
45:53
So these blacks I was like "Come on dude Wow."
45:59
Oh man You're right about that dude I got to come see you in um I got to come
46:05
watch you in Cork Oh yeah Cork Ireland That was fun I forgot about that That
46:10
was fun That was cool wasn't it my buddy's wedding my buddy Scotty he's in town tonight They're going to see Rufus
46:16
all No way Yeah I thought about having him come by the house but um my truck broke down I cried for a little bit and
46:22
I got kind of scared and I just hurried back home Yeah the axle One bad axle dude Um Oh dude What
46:30
do you think about Bill Bich's girlfriend what's the word down there because he lives in Florida doesn't he he lives in I think Nantucket or or
46:38
obviously Chapel Hill now but Okay North Florida or whatever North Florida But he's going to your own mutter Yeah And
46:45
it's it's kind of crazy I mean it's like um people are talking about the program
46:50
so that's a positive right well to me college football is 100,000% about the
46:56
players I mean all football is but especially college football and I think him coming we got a big budget increase
47:03
for what we were willing to give NIL players or or the NIL money for like
47:08
guys to recruits So you think boosters hit followed him i I think that we really raised a lot of I don't know what
47:13
the figure is but I want to say it was like 30 million bucks or something It was like kind of like the And I don't know if that includes um coaches or what
47:20
but it was it was a huge figure that you would think we would be able to go out and get like five star quarterback five
47:26
star whatever And I haven't seen us signing any five stars yet But that
47:31
could just be the period of the year we're in And my thing is if he signs those five five stars it doesn't matter
47:37
about his girlfriend And if he doesn't sign those five stars it doesn't matter about his girlfriend because we're gonna be asked no matter what his girlfriend
47:43
says I mean that's the truth dude We have to sign good players and pay them
47:49
dude I thought that Nico I'm a Tennessee football fan for college I mean obviously I played at Carolina so I root for Carolina as well but Tennessee is
47:56
who I grew up on And they didn't pay Nico or that's a story They didn't pay
48:01
their quarterback He wanted like $4 million is the story and they're giving him two And so they said "Get out of here." I think it's crazy I think pay
48:08
pay him Everyone was on Tennessee side right everyone thought Nico's idiot And maybe that's true but to me I would have
48:15
liked to see Tennessee just pay up He's a freshman He took you his real freshman year he beat Clemson in the first time
48:22
he ever played in the uh whatever Orange Bowl or something Yeah And then last year was his red shirt freshman year He took Tennessee to the playoffs I This
48:29
guy's in my opinion going to be the number one overall draft pick And they're talking about two million bucks with him He probably makes $100 million
48:35
for the university Yeah Him being on the field having a good team playoff competitive I mean you've been down there Oh it's unbelievable Down there
48:42
People were certainly excited about him the year before I remember remember when he got in in the uh bowl game the year
48:47
before Didn't he have to play the bowl game yeah Clemson he beat Clemson right so people were stoked They're like "Put him in." You know everybody was excited
48:54
Even that year when they were losing to Georgia late in the season they're like "Put him in." I think he was like the
48:59
number one overall pick recruit People were excited And he did well Well you're right It's only one year You
49:05
can't you know you can't expect guys just to or maybe now people can People are
49:12
saying now though here I think this is it People are saying now well we're putting our money in we better get a
49:18
return on it fast right that's so I think that's part that part of the mindset probably doesn't help the whole equation right but a lot of these guys
49:25
Lane Keifin was telling you go through one section of the portal time and then they haven't even played any ball yet
49:30
There's another portal period and they're like "You know what you gave us two million we want four million." Like
49:36
we haven't done anything It's insane They had to fix it College football is [ __ ] right now So that's pretty crazy
49:42
that the fact that that's happening you know Dude they got rid of walk-ons There's no more walk-ons in college football Like I was a I walked on to the
49:49
University of North Carolina and my Yeah you were loitering They said I also one of the an interview with the former
49:56
coach said this guy was loitering Yeah they hated me while I was there Um but
50:01
dude there's no walk-ons anymore Like our team our best maybe not our best players but the team captains some of
50:06
our best players were walk-ons Like I came in with um the my class of of
50:11
fellow guys every single one of them went on to win a scholar get a scholarship A lot of them went to the NFL Yeah And it's like they were like
50:17
the meat of the team or the the glue of the team and they don't even have that anymore because they they had to cut the
50:23
roster down They got to pay all these guys and that's sad to me Is that true has NIL Google that please has NIL
50:30
eliminated the possibility of walk-ons or lowered the number of
50:36
walk-ons on teams i think it's I think they don't even do it anymore I really don't think they even take walk-ons I
50:42
think it's a the death of the walk-on Okay Yes The new NCA roster limits
50:48
including the house settlement have effectively reduced the number of walk-on opportunities in college sports
50:53
particularly football While teams still have non-scolarship players walk-ons the total roster size is capped at 105
51:00
significantly reducing the space for them Wow So the movie Hooers years from now people will watch
51:07
Hoosiers and be like "Who the [ __ ] is that dude?" Rudy Yeah But it won't even understand like what the Yeah Yeah It's
51:13
It's It is sad man And then Oh it is It definitely takes away a lot of the heart of it Well dude also just like I just
51:19
had such an awesome positive experience being in the locker room for four years with the same guys going through it You
51:25
have these big aspirational dreams you're going to make to see the field Never see the field but you're you you
51:31
had a I had a great time And that doesn't happen anymore Not only because there's not walk-ons but also because
51:37
they um there's no they don't Why would you cultivate a backup if you're the coach if he's just about to transfer on
51:44
your ass soon as the season's over Your starter's probably going to transfer These guys are playing on a different team every year Sometimes two teams per
51:52
year So like there's no cont there's no locker room vibe They're all just like trying to get get the cash There has to
51:58
be a way People are acting like well we had it better back then and now it's like totally destroyed It's like is
52:04
there no creative problem solving to figure out how we can get these guys some cash and also like is there no
52:10
middle ground here that we can work with they h like can they just Okay you
52:15
have to stay You can sit out The argument has always been you can't transfer Yeah Um and then you have to
52:22
sit out a year That's how it used to be Now you can transfer and play immediately I think you should have to sit out a year And they say Yeah Because
52:27
that'll hold them off They That's how it used to be right cuz you got to say so then you have to put your at least you
52:33
got to show up for where you are Yeah And then the argument against it was well coaches can just leave and then you
52:39
know you're left with a coach that you didn't really sign up to play for Well then make an exception and if that's a coach leaves then you can go Then you
52:45
can do it People are acting like these it's like it's a pretty simple but then this will start to happen A coach will
52:51
leave and he'll make a deal with the players and then the player will follow him It'll be like a deal that they make Yeah Which is which is what's wrong with
52:57
that right that's part of the deal That's part of the deal if those are his players So yeah I think there's a lot
53:02
obviously even us trying to look at it there's a lot of little sides to it man Um but you're right It does start to it
53:09
starts to kind of break the heart of the fan you know cuz you're kind of the one that loses in the end Mhm Is just the
53:16
value of being a fan It all just becomes this kind of capitalist thing But for years those places the universe was
53:21
making so much money and they weren't even setting aside like set aside the money for 10 years later every player
53:27
gets a you know what I'm saying like there should be money It's like maybe you don't give it to them now but you five years from now they're going to get
53:33
paid you know right or when they graduate or when they're done at college you know but there's there just has to be a way And it does And sports fans I
53:41
mean I grew up a Tennessee football fan SEC football there's no fans like that
53:46
because in NFL you can't go you can't play for the team or go to the team In
53:52
college you can go to that school You can like if you're a fan you went to the school Yeah You can go to the Packers
53:58
You know what I'm saying like you just [ __ ] you go to the game but you go to that school You spent four years of your life there Like that's your team Yeah
54:05
You knocked your spouse up there Yeah You know you vomited on your buddy there You guys accidentally touched each other
54:13
there Yeah Right It didn't It was an accident Some of you guys say you hit a speed bump going really fast in a truck
54:19
People don't usually come during that But hey you know what I'm saying that's what you get for going to Mississippi
54:25
State Yeah But what I'm trying to say Starkville is ass bro Have you been there oh no Don't play that dude They in
54:31
somebody invited me there and I couldn't even find it I looking for pictures I had to text Hardy Dude the what's in
54:37
Starkville is Hardies and that's all that's there dude It's a long drawn silvers and a Hardies dude Hardys and I
54:43
hate to say this but it's the truth It's just a uh Carl's Jr that came out of the closet That's all it is Bring that up
54:49
Does Hardies own Carl's Jr what's the other one that's like that oh the uh Hillstone And what's that good
54:55
restaurant call Oh honey I wouldn't know Hardies Yes Hardies is owned by the same company as Carl's Junior [ __ ] Okay What
55:04
is the reason for not having just the same so don't say I didn't go to college That's all I'm saying That's a question

1:03:27
even if he's not lying I know that the human body makes like three billion sperms a day or something crazy Yeah

You might have needed an arc can after that homie That's a That's a warm Oh that's a big dose boy Got What do you do
1:10:17
with that that is uh and and so R I guess the last question
1:10:22
is just the first one I asked is have you been doing it more and more or Yeah I have You're addicted to it not
1:10:30
addicted Are you a sex addict no How many times you feel like you've had sex since that happened Raleigh cuz it's
1:10:35
been about eight months now Almost one year hasn't it yeah about um I would
1:10:43
say a couple times few times a week Okay Whoa Good God bro Slow down You have Do
1:10:51
you think you have any kids or do you think that is that something you're interested in doing uh eventually Yeah
1:10:56
And what about your walk with God i know you were saving yourself from marriage right right And that went by the wayside
1:11:01
Blew that You [ __ ] that up Oh that's like kicking over the only [ __ ] at a
1:11:08
[ __ ] at a good wedding brother But anyway man sorry putting you on the
1:11:14
grill there Um do you feel like you're gaining traction in the sexual community or whatever like or that you're getting
1:11:20
better at it or whatever yeah I think so Oh that's good man Wow Do you feel any
1:11:26
different you know do do you remember if you felt any different after the first time you had sex Caleb i I can't
1:11:31
remember Yeah I can't remember Dude you know what I always think about is how
1:11:36
when I was growing up you kind of have like people who maybe from your high school or whatever just people you're
1:11:42
growing up with uh in your town who get pregnant in high school or like you know they they and then at the time I would
1:11:49
look at them I looked at them like now they were bad people but like wow what idiots Yes You know which obviously they
1:11:55
probably wish they didn't but all they did was do the same thing every single
1:12:02
other person's doing Yeah every single person's doing that and then all that
1:12:07
happens is one of them gets unlucky and then you're like idiot That's how I was I've changed my stance on that Well they
1:12:14
kind of get unlucky It's almost like you know when they say if you shake a soda up and everything don't open it for a little while right And then one guy
1:12:22
right or who's like I'mma open it
1:12:27
You know what's going to happen if you open it right And he still opens it It does feel like those are the people a
1:12:33
lot of the times who do have and that's you know ch high school children but I
1:12:38
wonder if I had meet a little child where I would keep what I would do with it or whatever I would let it be outside or inside Probably outside more I cannot
1:12:45
wait till you have a kid Mom I can't wait to meet him That be cool huh that would be cool Riley are
1:12:52
you guys thinking about ch cuz you have a girlfriend now Riley i do Okay And are you thinking about children have you guys started talking about it uh
1:12:59
eventually Yeah Wow Wow Do you miss the days when you hadn't
1:13:06

1:13:12
out there just spackling that that uh Hanoi sauce or whatever you guys are
1:13:20

1:13:27
Wow In a negative way or positive uh positive Wow Oh really so you feel like you have more testosterone now yep Amen
1:13:34
brother That's kind of the key phrase nowadays Testosterone People are selling
1:13:39
it everywhere Every other Facebook's ads like "Shoot up at your apartment." Yeah dude When I was young you had to go
1:13:45
first of all meet a gay dude that you didn't even know because you he said he wasn't gay He was just a bus boy that
1:13:50
was in his 40s at a restaurant right okay You had to meet him befriend him by playing video games Then he had steroids
1:13:58
You had to go get it from somewhere It was crazy Now they're mailing you steroids Shut up Really yeah We had to
1:14:03
go through all this [ __ ] to get it It is crazy There's a cold plunge place by my house It's like you this a sauna and cold plunge You go there and then the
1:14:09
guy is like "Hey do you want some uh testosterone or anything?" That's like "No dude I don't even want to get in
1:14:14
this [ __ ] cold tub I don't want testosterone." I do want it dude I do I I honestly I would love to see what it
1:14:21
would be like People say they feel so much better Dude have him cream you out half an ounce over there and get you a
1:14:27
little bit Crazy bro Have you get you a little bit of that [ __ ] sweet and sour pants syrup
1:14:36

1:14:41
eyebrows thicker dude Um do you miss the days of uh not having had sex Raleigh to
1:14:47
be honest with you or something you miss about it uh no No I don't miss it That's cool
1:14:52
man Well what else were we talking about oh dude Do you think the Bill Bichc
1:14:57
thing has adjusted the dating the way that dating is looked because it's kind of a big like he kind of opened the
1:15:03
portal like the portal's open for older men and younger women Do you feel like
1:15:09
that i feel my stance on this is I actually don't have a problem with it I don't understand why if you're a young
1:15:16
girl you'd want to be with an old man Yeah But I don't understand a lot of stuff people do But if she's 20 and
1:15:23
they're consenting adults like I have no problem with an older dude who's single I would try to get a younger girl too
1:15:30
I'm not going to try to get a 75year-old woman Well first of all you're single
1:15:35

1:15:41
Jim has Yeah You get what you get dude You know Um but damn dude That's such a
1:15:47
good question Like but he definitely the portal's open now I feel like it's definitely it feels like it's more of
1:15:54
that universe now Have you seen any more of it have you seen other examples of it well Shannon Sharp had his thing but he
1:16:00
got kind of got called out for but his was more of like sexual in nature whereas Bellich has a it's it seems like

1:16:48
that movie is Normandy or whatever It's like there it was like they did like this D-Day photo shoot or whatever
1:16:54
Uh Dave Portoy has a good theory on this Um Dave's theory is that he has no idea
1:17:00
what's going on like in terms of how we're all perceiving this and like social media about it He's like his theory is that Dave Bill is not on his
1:17:06
phone and just doesn't have any clue what's happening right so he's just enjoying his life He's just like going about his life loving his life cuz I
1:17:13

1:18:12
attracted to guys who have money and guys who are successful and they don't seem to care about looks and it doesn't
1:18:17

1:21:34
ultimate stress You're putting yourself in your starvation But the third day of fasting your body's like "Now we're
1:21:40

1:21:46
don't I don't I don't I believe it does clean you up I don't believe I don't believe that you feel good People are
1:21:52
like "Yeah I've been You start feeling amazing after 3 days." I bet you're hungry Oh yeah You're hungry but you
1:21:57
feel like I think you feel kind of a little bit keen I saw a thing the other day that a guy lived for a long You can
1:22:05
pull this pull this up The guy lived on just sunlight for over a year He didn't
1:22:10
eat for over a year and he's just he was looking at the sun H that's nice Let me
1:22:16
see him Manic Uh he had earned a spot in the Guinness book for not eating anything
1:22:22
for 411 days straight in 2001 I had led a team of 24 doctors and physicians to
1:22:27
monitor this feat said city-based neuroysician Sudier Sha Um his team
1:22:34
carried out a number of tests and the results showed him to be a person of normal health There were documentary films made
1:22:40
on Manx's feet Manic had given up solid food for almost two decades Dang And he
1:22:46
stopped pooping too He stopped pooping after like the third week or something Oh that's got to be great Didn't poop for a full year It's got to be great
1:22:52
It's like driving a Tesla It's like you don't have to It's like you don't have to stop to fill up or whatever It's like or unfill It's so good Oh that's good He
1:23:00
was working as a trader of perfumes It says in Kos
1:23:05
sungazing How do you do that you're not supposed to do that Or is that just another lie they tell you not to look at
1:23:12
the sun A lot of stepdads would say that You know if you stare directly into the sun your sister will accuse me of sexual
1:23:19
harassment You're like what turns out it's pretty true In a lot
1:23:25
of areas dude In a lot of areas dude Uh but I think I think what that would I
1:23:31
guess you'd have to build up like a tolerance to it Like you start looking at it when it's small in the morning and then over days and days you can just for
1:23:38
the mid days you beam that [ __ ] out in the middle of the day and you just I
1:23:45
mean at some point you locked in on that [ __ ] You know what I'm saying you just collecting heat You a damn solar panel
1:23:51
at that point That's what it that's what he's saying bro That is what he's saying
1:23:56
I didn't realize that He's over there charging his phone He's just got it in his hand
1:24:02
10% 11% Dude can you find a video of this guy speaking Raleigh
1:24:11
he only lived till 85 which is a good number It's a good life He put up a good game but that's not it's not 100
1:24:19
That's true How How long do you want to live for but living is going to start to get different I want to I want to I want to go over a couple things with you
1:24:24
First of all and shout out also Winnipeg Jets today dude Did you see their win the other night
1:24:31
bro it's hockey right okay And I met this player I met this guy in a um bath house
1:24:39
or whatever Like a um I don't remember where it was Vancouver somewhere Mhm He's putting lip balm on I walk in a
1:24:46
sauna or whatever He's sitting there by himself putting on lip balm Where's this going
1:24:51
do you have my interest i didn't judge him You know what I'm saying i was like
1:24:57
you know it's the can be dehydrating Mhm So anyway the game they're down 3 to one
1:25:04
Mhm With a minute and 7 seconds left they score Okay Two two-3 Yep Then with
1:25:11
1.7 seconds this series is tied 3-3 Game seven With 1.7 seconds they score again
1:25:18
Take it to overtime In the second overtime they win the game No way Yeah Pretty unbelievable Is that your team now wait what were you going to tell me
1:25:24
that has nothing to do with what you said Oh how long do you want to live for no you said I'm going to tell you a few
1:25:29
things Listen up This is what I'm going to tell you So first of all they have different skin now right i believe that
1:25:35
there's in the future this is I believe one of the last 5 years will be wearing this skin I believe they're going to
1:25:41
come out with a material right um that will completely
1:25:47
cover our skin So it'll both preserve your skin also allow your skin to breathe all the things that it needs to
1:25:53
do still with nature but that it will become a new layer right mhm that you
1:25:58
will probably will cover most of your body That will preserve your skin So I
1:26:04
believe that you'll start to see that So people will be able to technically look younger for longer right but you'll
1:26:10
never know because you won't see them You'll never know cuz you won't really see them You can't see their skin but under there it does look better but you
1:26:16
just can't see it right you just can't see it And they'll just be like "Hey I look great." And then people will also
1:26:21
be able to program based on that outer layer what they want you to see them wear right so at a certain point I don't
1:26:28
know how we'll do it but we'll start to have like you know glasses or uh contacts that will so you I can make
1:26:35
everybody look like they're we're in the 1900s today or something like that Who decides you decide what you want to look
1:26:40
like or you I can decide what you look like I think you get to decide the operator Naked You could I guess you go
1:26:47
naked but it's not I would do not not you naked Thank you I would go Yeah
1:26:52
somebody you could do like everybody's eating ice cream like Lenny Balls today Okay So you could get to pick and based
1:26:59
on your eyes everybody who has that skin you could adjust it because it'll be able to adjust it Does that make sense
1:27:05
[ __ ] This is the worst episode of my life Don't say that Sorry I'm sorry dude I'm breaking your heart man Sorry dude
1:27:12
Don't say that kind of stuff I just feel like I let you down today man Man I don't think you did at all I think it's
1:27:18
a really good episode I think you're going to have to cut out a lot I am I'll say this I'm excited about the
1:27:23
Indiana Fever starting back Yeah How have you kept up with Cuz we went to the game Yeah We went and saw Caitlin Clark
1:27:29
break the record dude It was so great And then the other day she's back there Shoots a three from further back than
1:27:35
the one we saw her break the record And we were right there when she broke the record So tough Have you Have you um been talking to Patrick yeah Patrick and
1:27:42
Connor dude Patrick came to see a show in Chicago a couple weeks ago It was pretty cool He's there training for the
1:27:47
uh NBA draft Patrick McCaffrey And then so that was great He came out and then
1:27:52
Yeah Connor and I have kept in touch Yeah we got to go see a game We went to the Applebees with him after Oh yeah it was so cool dude Dude yeah we got to go

1:28:13

1:28:26
bro You see Shabuzi at that Met Galla What was that he looked like a pepper shaker He looked like a pepper shaker
1:28:37
Wow Yeah that's a wild look isn't it do you think it wasn't bad oh no I don't think it was bad But I do Do you think
1:28:43
that there is a real truth because in a black culture they start say they dress a lot of black men up like women Yeah
1:28:48
I've heard that I don't know if that's true They dress white guys up like women Anyone who's trying to They dress those
1:28:53
guys are everyone looks like women at the the mech That's a good point Don't you think would you go to something like
1:28:59
that i've always thought about that Like not that I would ever If you and me went I would go I wouldn't go uh like with
1:29:06
some public I don't like a weird type of like almost like celebrity worship where
1:29:12
it's like too much I don't know It kind of weirds me out to be honest with you Yeah I don't It seems like a seance to
1:29:18
me It has seancey vibes to me a little bit and I just wonder like Yeah there's
1:29:24
something about it that has um seance type of vibes to me or whatever that's called like when you meet in the woods
1:29:30
or whatever and do something wild like that Um Oh dude I'll tell you this one story
1:29:35
So we're at we did some shows We did like SEC right some different places
1:29:41
We're at uh University of Arkansas Yep And Sam Pit we're leaving the gym right
1:29:46
we get to go use their gym I know Coach Pitman He was at Carolina when I was there No way Yeah dude He's awesome Right So we're leaving the gym and it's
1:29:54
me and Amir K this comedian that works with me on the road And dude so we're leaving and um we see this guy pull up
1:30:01
in this cart and it's Coach Pitman And he comes over He's like "What's going on fellas?" Starts talking to us He's like
1:30:07
"Man tell me about Bobby." And so I'm thinking he's thinking about Bobby Kennedy Jr right so we start talking
1:30:14
about Bobby Kennedy for like two two minutes I mean Amir is doing like an imperson mean
1:30:23
uh he's impersonation everything and he he's coach coach Pitman's like going
1:30:28
along with us and then he goes Bobby just like Bobby le Bobby Lee
1:30:40
and I like why you listen to us for two minutes do a horrible imperson
1:30:45
impersonations of RFK Jr just so he can go Bobby Did you get to hang out with
1:30:51
Coach Fman uh dude he is funny dude He talked to us for like 20 minutes It was one of the highlights of our trip That
1:30:56
and um the Alabama players were so cool man When we went there just took us around their uh facility and stuff
1:31:02
Really they were super nice Every place was cool but they like they just went out of their way you know like some of
1:31:08
their best players A lot of times the guys are too cool to do that type of [ __ ] you know but it was great man Did you get to talk to the new coach at
1:31:15
Alabama yeah No we did not get to meet him So I wish I we would have but but it
1:31:20
was great though just to get to go to some of the SEC places and like you said earlier it's like they mean it at these school It's like part of the deal
1:31:27
Alabama Yeah And that campus is nice That's the nicest campus They said it's
1:31:32
gotten way nicer because of the victories that they have% through the saving years 100% I think it's harder to
1:31:38
get into Alabama now because of football being good because they have more people who want to go so they can be they can
1:31:43
have like smart people down in Alabama now Yeah Not that they weren't No but they weren't back in the day They have
1:31:49
Appalachin State too but where I'm from Appalachin State won like three uh national championships in a row and then
1:31:54
they had so many more applicants after they beat Michigan Yeah That they that school went from kind of like a just anyone could kind of get into like a
1:32:00
competitive school like quadrupled their their uh people who tried to to go to
1:32:06
App State Damn It's like a nice school now But that Tuscaloosa has the best setup of any because I did that tour
1:32:12
when I first graduated um college The first thing I did was like two years on the road living in a bus going to
1:32:18
colleges Yeah And just we just went to every college and just party That was my job for like two years And Tuscaloosa is
1:32:25
the nicest one They got that perfect setup right they got the stadium Oh dude We got to go out on the field No way We
1:32:32
got to run out on the field man Yeah It was crazy But you're kind of one of those guys that switch up like you'll be
1:32:37
you were supposed to be a Tennessee fan but I don't have a lot of faith in you at all Well remember we went back there
1:32:43
and they didn't really welcome us back It felt like you remember No cuz we couldn't find the field It was not cuz
1:32:49
they weren't welcoming us We got lost Yeah you're right We got lost for about 45 minutes trying to find the field I
1:32:54
think I'm just I've realized I'm an SEC I'm just I am an SEC guy man It's all I like to watch It's the best It's not
1:33:00
even close It's not even close It's not The rest of it should just Why are they doing it it's not even close ACC
1:33:06
basketball is awesome but SEC basketball is awesome now Yeah Yeah My favorite sport was always LSU basketball Um
1:33:15
but yeah I think you know it's like I'm a Winnipeg Jets fan It's tough I mean
1:33:21
SEC is so good It's like you just I don't know You start to love it all I think they only have like 13 sports
1:33:28
where like Carolina we have like 33 sports and so they just dump all that money cuz only sports that make any
1:33:33
money are men's basketball and football Yeah All the rest of the sports lose money And so if they only have 13 sports
1:33:41
they can take all that money and just dump them right back into Yeah the the good ones Whereas you got to spread it all out at like Stanford has like 33
1:33:48
sports They got like fencing and [ __ ] every you know Yeah Uh
1:33:54
transing Like come on dude Transing is a sport Things have
1:34:01
changed man Uh no but there's nothing better than being like just loving the SEC man And living in Nashville is so
1:34:07
great because you get it's easy to get to a lot of the schools man It really is like it's just a little bit easier So like um that's been great dude Yeah
1:34:15
Everything's been good dude We got to go see an Indiana Fever game though That would be really fun They got a they're they're they got a bunch of new players

1:34:32

1:34:38
