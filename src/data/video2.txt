[Music] we're sitting here at the Google Plex with the CEO of Alphabet Sundar thanks
0:08
for being here great to have you here David look forward to it is Google at risk of being truly disrupted from AI
0:14
recently we're testing it in labs this whole new dedicated AI experience called AI mode coming to search open AI has SAM
0:22
XAI has Elon Meta has Zuck Microsoft has Satcha are you willing to kind of share
0:28
your perspectives on those four competitors i think maybe only one of them has invited me to a dance not the others biggest regret look there are
0:36
acquisitions we debated hard came close just give me one name or get in trouble maybe Netflix we
0:44
just leaned into the user experience and over time we figured out monetization to follow it's like one of the original
0:51
principles of Google follow the user all will follow there you go i'm going all
0:56
in all right besties i think that was another epic discussion people love the interviews i could hear him talk for
1:03
hours absolutely oh he crushed your questions in a minute we are giving people ground truth data to underwrite
1:08
your own opinion what do you guys think that was fun that was great what's going on i'm really excited for this
1:14
conversation you and I started working at Google on the same day in 2004 i
1:21
didn't quite realize that same nougler class we had the the hats on that same week on the Friday all hands i'm now a
1:28
podcaster you've done a little bit differently you're more than you're more than a podcaster but you're very good at
1:34
podcasting well I appreciate it i think I respect the other stuff you've done as well so no I appreciate it but in your
1:41
tenure at Google you ran Chrome Chrome OS Drive Google Maps and it's been 10
1:48
years now since you've been the CEO here at Google Now Alphabet amazing and congratulations under your tenure as CEO
1:55
the stock has gone up by 4 and a.5x to a$2 trillion market cap today you've
2:00
grown revenue from 20 billion a quarter to nearly hundred billion a quarter it's been a really like incredible run to see
2:06
someone that kind of started as a a PM and you know grew your way into this
2:11
incredible role so congrats how have you liked the job no look I mean uh I love building
2:18
products and in some ways you know Google was really set up I think the
2:23
founders set up this kind of a deep computer science approach and like you
2:29
take that and apply it to build things which can impact people on a day-to-day basis and so you know it's that kind of
2:35
a product and uh technical culture which you know is is the essence of the
2:41
company so I love doing that and you know there's not a single week which goes by where I I feel like I don't get
2:48
to do that so those are the parts I really enjoy but obviously you know running a company of this scale where
2:54
you impact uh so many people I think it's a privilege so enjoyed every part of it you're at a pivotal moment in the
Will AI kill search?: Google disrupting itself, evolving search to follow the user
3:00
company's history today have you read the innovators dilemma uh you know my I
3:05
I I'm obviously very very familiar with the concept i don't think I've read the book actually but but you know it's one
3:10
of those things which is so much in the ether you think you know it you know i say it in justest because that's the
3:16
talk of the town the talk on Wall Street the talk in Silicon Valley is Google getting disrupted in this moment ai
3:23
seems to create a fundamentally different paradigm for human computer interaction consumers are asking AI
3:29
questions through chat interfaces they're getting complete answers they're engaging with AI systems in a way that
3:35
they traditionally didn't do with the classical search interface is Google at risk of being truly disrupted from AI is
3:43
the core search business which the ad revenue and search is about a $200 billion run rate out of 360 billion of
3:49
your total revenue most of your profits and it seems like Google's in a really
3:54
challenging quandry where if you disrupt yourselves too quickly all of that revenue can go away it can be really
4:00
impactful so is Google being disrupted by AI at this moment or is Google leading it's a good framework good
4:06
question to talk about uh you know I've definitely uh you know for almost a decade uh you know one of the first
4:13
things I did was to think of the company as AI first it was very clear to us uh
4:18
we had Google brain underway in 2012 we acquired deep mind in 2014 2015 when I
4:23
became the CEO I said look the technology is really evolving the reason we were excited to be approach our work
4:29
as AI first uh is because we really felt that AI is what will drive the biggest progress in
4:35
search and so you know I I think even the last couple of years I viewed this
4:42
as an extraordinary opportunity for search i think if you look at how much
4:47
information means to people I think they're going to each person is going to
4:52
have access to information in a way they've never had before so it feels very far from a zero sum construct to me
5:00
and we are seeing it empirically when people are using search obviously there are a couple of major things uh we've
5:06
done with search uh you know transformers drove some of the biggest innovations in search with BERT and mom
5:13
dramatically improved search quality um we we launched AI overviews about a year
5:19
ago it's now being used by over one and a half billion users uh in over 150
5:25
countries it's expanding the types of queries people can type in and we see it
5:31
empirically the nature of queries is expanded so there are whole new use cases coming into search we find for
5:38
queries where we trigger AI overviews uh you know we see query growth and the growth continues over time you know
5:45
getting the feedback from AI overviews we are you know we we've recently we're testing it in labs there's a whole new
5:51
dedicated AI experience called AI mode coming to search we'll speak about it more at Google IO and in AI mode you can
5:59
have a full-on AI experience in in search including follow on conversational queries and we're
6:07
bringing our cutting edge models there uh where the models are actually working to answer your questions using search as
6:14
a real native tool right and and there the queries people are typing in queries
6:20
like literally long paragraphs right the average query length is somewhere two to three times is what we see in uh search
6:27
as it existed uh two years ago so we are seeing people respond uh you know search
6:33
is always from the outside people look at it and say search all kind of looks easy to do the craft of search is very
6:38
hard over two decades I think we've had a real northstar of understanding what users want in search and you know we you
6:46
know you've been here we kind of a very metrics driven company we kind of know what works uh users are are our
6:53
northstar and and empirically we see that people are engaging more and using the product more right so uh so all that
7:01
uh to your question about innovators dilemma I think the dilemma only exists
7:06
if you treat it as a dilemma right like you know so for me all along in technology you have these massive uh
7:14
periods of innovation and you lean into it as hard as you can it's the only way to do it you know when mobile came
7:20
everyone was like well you know it's like you're not going to have the real estate like how will ads work all that
7:26
stuff uh you know mobile was a transition which ended ended up working great i can give great examples right
7:32
like Tik Tok has come in youtube has thrived since the moment Tik Tok has
7:37
come in right and uh it was a whole new format we we uh did shorts when we
7:44
launched shorts shorts absolutely didn't monetize anywhere near long form but we
7:50
just leaned into the user experience and over time and we figured out monetization to follow so you know to me
7:57
you know you don't think about it as a dilemma like you know because users you have to innovate to stay ahead and you
8:03
kind of lean in that direction it's like one of the original principles of Google follow the user all else will follow
8:10
there you go and I think the the Google is dead disruptor narrative has as you
8:16
point out been kind of repeated a number of times today people are pointing specifically and I appreciate your
8:21
points about there's new search experiences coming the search experience it sounds like is going to evolve as
8:28
people look at standalone apps they compare Gemini as a standalone app to chat GPT to the meta experience the
8:34
stats that came out in the recent court testimony that had some data revealed from March i don't know where the data
8:40
came from but it said the uh Gemini AI app had 350 million monthly users
8:45
compared to Chat GPT at 600 and Meta AI at 500 is that the wrong way to think
8:50
about it that the Gemini standalone app isn't the future or the AI bet that Google's making but it sounds like
8:56
there's going to be much more of a kind of timed out integration into how the search experience evolves and what
9:01
happens to Gemini you know in search you know maybe the most widely used GI
9:07
product today might be search with AI overviews right you know uh people people are using it intensely obviously
9:14
uh we have a standalone Gemini app um I think I think uh we are making progress
9:19
there particularly with the introduction of Gemini 2.5 Pro we've seen a real uh
9:25
uptick in engagement uh and usage growth uh in the product we have a lot more to
9:32
come just in the last few weeks we've shipped deep research and updated canvas
9:37
audio overviews you can now go and generate v do video generation with V2
9:43
straight in the Gemini app uh on Android phones with Gemini live you know you can
9:48
screen share it can talk to what's on your screen so the the you know there's
9:54
a lot coming that way and you know users are responding um look chat GPD is obviously had
10:00
phenomenal success um you know but but I think it's still early days and you know
10:05
we are definitely seeing traction seeing growth to me what matters is if you
10:11
innovate are users responding and using it more and that seems to be the case so it's in our hands to continue innovating
10:18
right I think it's a fiercely competitive moment but I would say across our products people are coming
10:24
and using and consuming information across search using the Gemini model
10:30
increasingly in YouTube in the Gemini app and so on so I think I think it's a much broader view we have if I were to
10:37
think about the unit economics of Google's business there's a cost to
10:42
serve a search query and there's revenue per search query ad revenue per search query how is that number changing or how
10:51
will that change in this kind of evolution in search towards more of an AI interface because I've got to assume
10:58
that to serve an AI driven query is much more expensive than to serve a search
11:03
query look this is something I think you know people are really worried about uh two years ago but you I've always felt
11:10
to the extent that something is about the cost of serving it Google with its
11:15
infrastructure I' I'd wager on that right and you know on our chances to do that better than pretty much anyone else
11:22
and you know we have actually seen like you know for a given query the cost to
11:28
serve that query is fallen dramatically in a 18-month time frame what is probably more of a constraint is latency
11:34
I would say so it's less the cost per query i think our ability to serve the
11:40
experience at the right latency you know search has been near instant so how do you uh think about that frontier has
11:48
been more of a question uh the cost per query is not what I think will end up uh
11:53
you know I think I think we'll be able to we've done the transition well that's that's not a primary driver of how it'll
11:59
impact things yeah and do you have a point of view on ad revenue per AI query you know we already with AI overviews um
12:07
you know we we are at the baseline of uh uh you know it's the same as without AI overviews and so we we've reached that
12:14
stage in uh so but from there we can improve right and I think uh you I've
12:20
always felt uh you know the reason ads have worked well in search is because
12:25
commercial information is also information people in when they have that intent are looking for that most
12:31
relevant information so I don't see any reason why AI you know just from a first
12:36
principal standpoint why won't AI do a better job there as well right and and and and so I think I think you know I
12:44
think we're comfortable that we can work the transition through some of it may take time but all indicators are that
12:50
we'll be able to do it well over time over time but you know it's already you know already AI overviews when we show
12:56
ads we've kind of reached the baseline do you feel that pressure on Wall Street and the board and like what's the
13:03
tension that you feel as a leader in trying to manage this transition on the
13:08
product on the revenue model for an organization of this scale i don't know how many leaders have done it
13:14
successfully in the history of business where do you feel the tension where do you feel the pressure and how much
13:20
leeway are you being given by the founders and the board to do what's needed here two things i mean the main
13:26
it's a moment of acceleration right so if anything um the good thing about these moments is you don't even have
13:32
time a lot of times to think about you know some of those questions you are uh I think I think a lot about making sure
13:38
we have the best models we are we pushing the frontier as a company uh and
13:44
I think the last few months have shown the breadth and range of what we are doing uh you know uh we are there and we
13:50
have to continue to stay there so for me you know you you think and you worry a lot more about execution from within
13:57
that's all you know are we are we executing are we moving fast are we innovating and I think you know over the
14:03
past 12 months I think we've really picked up pace as a company and uh you know to to meet the moment so that's
14:09
where I do spend a lot of time look as a as a CEO one of the first things I did in 2015 in addition to being AI first
14:15
was to really bet big on you know we had great products like YouTube we had
14:21
workspace and cloud but really turning them into robust businesses right as
14:27
well as great products last year we exited a combination of YouTube and cloud at $110 billion i think you know
14:36
people don't internalize that Google is one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world now uh and and so
14:42
look I think and the largest media company you know in in some ways right and you know definitely we're doing a
14:48
podcast i think we're the largest podcasting service in the world and so you know so I I I feel like you know as
14:54
a company we are set up well for the first time you have this crosscutting technology you know to to our earlier
15:00
point thinking of us as a deep computer science company what better technology than AI which horizontally can impact
15:07
all aspects of our business search YouTube cloud and the other new things we are doing so it feels like an
15:14
exciting time so not a lot of what you know we've continued to do well in search we are doing well in these other
15:21
businesses um and so to me it feels like you know one of the biggest opportunities ahead as a company too i
15:28
think the next decade ahead looks to me as exciting as the past decade so as I
Infrastructure advantage, foundational model differentiation
15:33
think about my time at Google right below us in the
15:39
garage and his team were building these super secret shipping container data
15:44
centers they had these like data center in a box that you could ship anywhere as long as you had access to water and
15:49
power could connect to the internet and you could scale data center capacity all over the world that was 20 years ago um
15:57
it's always seemed to me that one of Google's core and not well understood advantages was its infrastructure
16:03
advantage something that Google's invested in to its core from the beginning can you tell me a little bit
16:09
about where you view Google's infrastructure advantage playing out in
16:15
the AI competitive landscape today how does it translate
16:20
into cost speed product quality and
16:26
where do you guys think about investing the 70 billion of capex this year in the chip layer in the networking the data
16:34
center we can unpack both right like where our capex is going but on your first part right like one of the ways
16:40
you know we look at the parto frontier of performance and cost Google literally
16:45
is on the parto frontier so we deliver the best models at the most cost
16:51
effective price point right like you know and our flash series of models are a real workhorse uh in the industry
16:58
right and and part of why we are able to do that uh is because you know we train
17:05
and serve our models on our infrastructure including TPUs right and we are in our seventh generation of TPUs
17:12
and uh we built our first version in 2017 um I remember talking about it at
17:18
Google IO probably people didn't pay attention to it because like you know why are you building a specific machine learning accelerated chip uh look it
17:26
plays out everywhere to your earlier question on cost per query in search the reason we feel comfortable we
17:32
can serve it at that scale scale uh because we are constantly innovating through each generation including chips
17:39
which are really really good at inference right and ironwood which is our latest in our TPU series a single
17:46
part of ironwood is over 40 exoflops right and and so the scale of these
17:52
things are incredible and and we have thought about our in all the way from
17:57
subc cables to the scale at which we do infrastructure is unparalleled and I
18:02
I've always viewed that full stack approach you know deep
18:08
infrastructure foundational fundamental R&D on top of it and then you build and
18:13
innovate on top of that and I think that approach will serve us well over time but it really you know empirically plays
18:20
out in you know the the cost at which we are able to provide our models part of the reason we've had a lot of traction
18:26
with Gemini 2.5 series is not only are they great models but we are offering it
18:31
at a very attractive value uh and we can do that because you know we we are driving our infrastructure cost down on
18:40
the $75 billion in capex for uh 2025 you know obviously majority of that
18:47
goes into servers data centers uh and so on
18:52
uh servers being the vast portion of it uh I would I would say on on looking at
18:58
2025 uh and looking at the compute part of the uh spend
19:04
uh half of that is going towards our cloud business in 2025 and obviously that is a very different uh u uh it's a
19:13
very different business to search and so on so uh a lot of it is to power the innovations in uh from Google deep mind
19:20
pushing the frontier and we're doing it across many dimensions right not just large language models but you know even
19:26
there doing it across not just text images video etc building uh world
19:32
models right so there's just a lot of uh innovation which we are pushing on the
19:37
frontier obviously to support our core products like search YouTube gemini etc but 50% of the compute goes towards
19:44
Google cloud Let's just talk about chips for a second this is a big part of the conversation is Nvidia's got the real
19:49
market monopoly in AI is what everyone says um do TPUs provide a wholesale
19:55
replacement for your need for NVIDIA in the supply chain or is NVIDIA still a core part of the mix in the data center
20:02
for training versus inference uh in LLM versus other models maybe just share
20:07
your your understanding of where like the mix evolves to for you guys look first of all at a high level Nvidia is a
20:13
phenomenal company uh you know Jensen is awesome we we have been working with
20:19
Nvidia now for a very very long time and we continue to do so right and we serve
20:25
a lot of the Gemini traffic on GPUs as well right and so we give customers choice etc internally we train our
20:32
Gemini models on TPUs right and and and we serve it that way across our products
20:38
but uh we use both and uh I do think look I I do think everyone in the industry is going to try and do
20:44
something like that but uh but you know it's it's you know Nvidia's R&D uh and
20:50
and their ability to drive that innovation uh their software stack is world class so you know they have a lot
20:56
of uh advantages as a company and I have extraordinary respect for them uh you
21:01
know but we've always had you know we are committed you know we are actually deploying GPUs internally as well i
21:07
think I like that flexibility and and uh but I I I we are also long-term
21:13
committed to the TPU direction as well so I think it's a good combination to have both and and I think we push each
21:21
other um you know and drive the frontier forward just going back so there there's an infrastructure advantage inherent in
21:28
all of the investment that's been made for 20 plus years and the continued investment a lot of folks have said that
21:34
some of the performance in foundational LLMs is kind of starting to plateau and
21:40
as a result we're seeing a less kind of differentiated landscape amongst the competitors and that's should be a
21:47
consideration for Google that's the outside kind of narrative can you share a little bit about and then I want to come back to nonLLM models where there's
21:54
other advantages for Google in a minute but maybe just on this point how much more um of uh an opportunity to continue
22:02
to evolve LLM is there where's Google's advantage lie in maintaining better
22:07
performance in the models over time I think maybe it was Andre Karpati who used the term AJI which is like he
22:14
called it artificial jag jag intelligence right so I think the progress is not going to be always
22:21
smooth right like you you go through these periods it looks like something slow and then you see a paradigm breakthrough etc and it's been going
22:27
like that for a while uh I think obviously over the last couple of years uh you know all of us scaled up on
22:33
pre-training and then there was a lot of momentum with post-training and then with inference compute uh and and and
22:41
now you know there's progress with how do you take all that and stitch together in agentic workflows and you know and
22:48
and and so on so I do think there's a lot of progress and it feels pretty
22:54
continuous to me right i think it's both true progress gets harder which I think will distinguish
23:02
the elite teams at least on the foundational side uh you know I think I
23:07
think I think that that might be a factor uh I felt the the harder the
23:12
problem is I think you know we are well set up for that uh I think I think we are well set up for that i do think we
23:18
are uh pushing the research frontier in a much broader way than most other
23:25
people beyond just LLMs transformer based models I mean diffusion you know
23:30
do you do uh diffusion based models all those areas we are exploring in a deep deep way right so
23:38
um and you know there's always the chance that we may reach a point where
23:43
you know you quite don't get that returns to the additional compute you're going put in but I quite haven't seen it
23:51
yet right it it the progress looks maybe harder because you're now dealing with a lots more compute so you're really
23:57
running into the loss of like can I actually get as many electricians as I can to build the data centers at the
24:03
speed like I you know all that stuff but I haven't seen or at least
24:08
talking to our researchers haven't seen anything fundamentally hey like we are not going to be able to move past this
24:15
point or something like that does Google have a data advantage with YouTube or other products or services are you able
24:21
to train on that data in a way that others can't i think we have the opportunity to create much better experiences for people i think people
24:28
use products like Gmail Calendar Docs YouTube search etc so with their permission taking that
24:35
personal context into account I think we can deliver much better experiences we
24:41
are working on that but it's it's something on which we have to deliver but I view that as one of the uh uh
24:47
differentiated innovation opportunities we have ahead as a company but it's something we are thoughtfully working on
24:54
uh we'll make progress there that makes a lot of sense if search evolves and I've been using a lot of voice AI tools
25:01
I find them incredible I can have a conversation access the news dive deep on a topic it's just it's so incredible
Future of human-computer interaction, hardware, competitive landscape in AI
25:10
what do Do you view the future of human computer interaction being 5 to 10 years
25:15
from now as AI evolves as computing evolves am I looking at a screen am I
25:21
typing in a chat am I using an AirPod and just getting audio am I doing audio
25:26
plus a screen is it just a personalized interface and there's no even concept of
25:31
the web what does the future look like for accessing information and pursuing my interests in
25:37
life as a human using compute it's a great question uh I do think you know the answer has got to be you know we've
25:44
always you humans have adapted to computing and it's always been that way
25:50
but over time the answer will be that you need to do less of the hard work less of the adaptation and computing
25:56
kind of works for you right and that's the holy grail I think and and we are
26:02
making progress right be touch be voice everything inches us towards this future
26:09
um for example When I wear AR glasses I already wear glasses so it's not that
26:15
you know but the AR glasses aren't quite as comfortable as my normal glasses but they're getting there it's obvious to me
26:22
that that'll push it to the next level of seamlessness where it kind of is ambiently there and doing stuff for you
26:30
so I think that's the arrow there you know the air of uh uh how it'll you know it has to be more seamless and just be
26:37
there for you you know will it be like neural link down the line right you know like you know when I when I want to understand something you know is it is
26:44
it that seamless right you know I I think all of that is a possibility but I think in the immediate
26:52
world given you're going to have really natively multimodal models which can
26:58
take you know audio vision language uh all of that and be there in your uh line
27:06
of view so I think when AR really works i think that'll wow people um I'm not
27:12
talking about immersive displays i'm talking more about AR glasses right and
27:18
I think I think that paradigm looks very interesting to me having used it you can kind of feel that next leap right where
27:26
uh I think we'll all enjoy using it in a way but you still have a little bit of system integration challenges to work
27:33
through so we have maybe couple cycles away to get to that sweet spot uh what smartphones were in around 2006
27:41
2007 so but maybe that's the next leap right and and so probably that's what's exciting for me are you spending a lot
27:47
of time on hardware yes right i think um we are definitely excited about be AR
27:54
glasses the next for form factors um you know uh robotics is another area
28:02
all that uh and we obviously build pixel phones uh you know we build vast data
28:08
centers so we are definitely in the physical world you can think of Whimo as a big robot we are driving around everywhere so we're making uh with our
28:15
partners cars that way so definitely yes I just want to zoom out and look at there's this competitive landscape
28:22
that's emerged for Google that maybe maybe it's always been challenging maybe there's always been competitors but
28:29
they're getting a lot of money and they're investing a lot of money more than to compete with Google how have the
28:36
founders of Google I've seen both of them recently sounds like Sergey's
28:41
spending time here uh they both independently shared with me that this is the most exciting thing they've ever
28:47
seen in computer science and it's transforming everything how engaged are they how much time do you spend with
28:52
them and what's your relationship like there they are you know obviously fortunate to have both of them uh
28:58
involved in their own unique ways uh deeply i talk to them all the time um
29:04
look I think both Larry Sergey I you know you know credit to them they always
29:09
envision like where AI would be i think uh you know I think I think their ability to understand trends and and you
29:17
know I I swear I've had conversations maybe as early as like 15 20 years ago
29:23
about moments like this with them i think they are both would argue that this is the most exciting uh time in the
29:30
field uh you know and and I they both engage in their own ways i think Sergey
29:35
is definitely uh spending time with the with the Gemini team at a uh you know in
29:41
a pretty hardcore way like you know sitting and coding and uh spending time with the engineers uh and that gives the
29:48
energy to the team which I think it's unparalleled right like to have a founder sitting there looking at loss
29:54
curves giving feedback on model architectures uh how can we improve post training etc
30:00
I think I think you know it's a it's a rare rare place to be But you know my favorite conversations are sometimes
30:07
when the three of us sit and talk uh the combination of I mean they are very nonlinear thinkers so I feel like it
30:15
expands the conversation into ways which you always don't expect and out of it
30:20
which comes interesting ideas so I think I always have access to that but I think I've worked with them uh for such a long
30:27
time you know you know there is friendship respect mutual dialogue uh we
30:32
love doing that and uh and I think it's uh we'll I'll always have that your competitors out there have active
30:39
founders openai has SAM XAI has Elon Meta has Zuck and um Microsoft has
30:47
Satcha are you willing to kind of share your perspectives on those four competitors both the companies and the
30:53
leaders look it's a obviously by by definition it's a very impressive group
30:58
right and um I think I think you're talking about some of the best companies some of the best entrepreneurs uh uh all
31:06
that look I I you know it shows how uh both how much progress we are going to see because
31:13
you're basically talking about many people uh who are working hard to drive
31:19
that progress right so to the earlier question when you were talking about are we going to see progress the answer has
31:25
got to be yes because of the uh you know the the unique types of people here
31:30
pushing progress right so look each of them they're they're different people I I fortunate to know all of them and I
31:38
think maybe only one of them has invited me to a dance not the others uh right but I just look I spent time with Elon
31:45
maybe two weeks ago um when I talked to him and his ability to will future
31:51
technologies into existence i think it's just unparalleled so like look these are phenomenal people i respect all of them
31:58
u you know there's partnerships involved there's competition involved but if I
32:03
were to step back and say you know at the end of the day I
32:10
love you know driving technology progress in a way that impacts people positively um when you think about areas
32:18
like healthcare and and other important areas education and you know like we are now talking about this is why AI is so
32:25
profound so the opportunity is what excites me I think all of us are going to do well in this scenario that's how I
32:31
think about it right I think that's what a lot of people don't gro and I think this is an important point everyone out
32:37
there says there's competitors there's a winner and everyone else is a loser but this is an entirely new world that's
32:43
going to be a lot bigger than the world we had last here and uh everyone's building down their own path but there's
32:49
going to be a lot of success it's not just that who's going to beat whom in the in the marketplace when the internet
32:56
happened right google wasn't even around right right so we obviously So the the
33:02
other thing you can say is there are companies we don't even know haven't been started yet their names aren't
33:09
known might be extraordinarily big winners in the AI thing right so it's
33:15
it's going to be AI is a much bigger uh landscape opportunity landscape than all
33:21
the previous technologies we have known combined combined and so you know so
33:26
which is why I think it's all about uh you know the companies which will end up doing well or you will do well because
33:32
you're able to innovate and execute with the best talent you know that's that ends up being the driver well let's talk
33:38
about that and let's talk about the unknown competitor Deepseek popped up tell me about your impression of the
33:44
model the performance the rumors about the next model and what does that tell you about what's going on in China and
33:50
what's going on that we're not seeing look I think the main moment from Deepseek was uh look always you know if
33:59
you if you kind of follow the AI research and scan through papers and read them no nobody who does that would
34:06
underestimate China right like you know so when you look at the amount of research output from China right um they
34:13
have extraordinary talent um and and and so but I do think all of
34:20
us had to adjust our priors a little bit after the deepseek moment which was like wow they are even closer to the frontier
34:29
than most people maybe assume you know and so I think I think that was a moment i think internally for us uh I think
34:35
externally people are very impressed and rightfully so with how efficient their models were interestingly for us
34:41
internally we benchmarked it to flash and you know flash was uh as efficient or you know you could argue in some ways
34:48
better so you know I think I think to our earlier conversations I I do think
34:54
this is more maybe internal baseball for us you know we were benchmarking and saying look it's good to see you know
35:00
because they had to work in a hardware constrained way I think which is what drove a lot of their uh innovations and
35:05
efficiency improvements and you know uh and so I was pleased with that but you
35:10
know it tells you that the frontier is is uh evolving rapidly there are more
35:17
players closer to it than people fully realize And it's going to be a very dynamic moment uh in the industry i
35:23
think China will will will be uh very very competitive on the AI frontier is just what I always assumed and much of
Energy constraints in AI
35:33
the narrative and I think probably the fact around the ability to deploy AI at
35:39
scale is one that is predicated on availability of electricity mhm even
35:46
Elon and I've been talking about this for a while on my podcast but Elon this week is saying "Hey I need a terowatt of compute." Uh terowatt is roughly the
35:53
power production or the electricity production capacity of the entire United States us is going from 1 to two between
35:59
now and 2040 china's going from 3 to 8 and there's probably upside given all the new electricity production
36:05
technologies that they're rolling out now which will be additive to that how much is electricity generation going to
36:11
play a role in who is going to economically benefit from AI over the
36:16
next 10 to 15 years and where is the US compared to China and maybe where is Google well look you are uh definitely
36:23
uh hitting on you know what is uh you know when you when you look at any system you want to find where the
36:30
constraint is because that's what like gates the whole system and you are rightfully identifying uh the most
36:36
likely constraint for uh AI progress and and hence by definition GDP growth and
36:43
all that stuff right so I do worry about it a lot um but you know the answers or
36:51
you know sometimes you run into challenges which are you know you have to solve you know you're running into
36:56
physics barriers or something like that this is not a problem like that right like we already know the technologies
37:04
that can work to supply the demand we need so it's more to me an an execution
37:12
challenge right i would I would phrase the energy problem as uh it's obviously multifaceted uh but I think I think be
37:20
it really embracing we shouldn't have innovators dilemma in the energy sector
37:26
right so we should lean into all the possible innovations ahead and there are many of them obviously first of all
37:33
people perpetually I think will underestimate solar right you know solar plus batteries will end up being huge uh
37:40
you know obviously uh the amount of innovation that's going into nuclear
37:45
geothermal all of that are uh opportunities to uh uh embrace and more
37:51
I'm not mentioning but I think you know upgrading the grid
37:56
uh you know solving for transmission uh you know permitting to
38:02
make all of that progress faster and then actually I think we maybe workforce constraint like you know to to my
38:08
earlier point Right you know I think we are all if you look at the number of
38:14
electricians leaving the workforce versus suddenly all of us and if you you
38:20
project out this demand there's a huge mismatch right so literally how you know how do you make sure there is incentives
38:28
and workforce development to address shortages like that over the next decade
38:34
will end up being important policies uh I think we are fortunate you know people like Secretary Wright and Secretary
38:40
Bergam I mean they are very I think deeply aware uh of the issue and I think
38:45
they are uh hitting hitting the problem hard but I definitely think it's
38:50
solvable but I think we all have to put our mind towards it but for your business today you don't see electricity
38:56
constraining growth in the business in this moment or in the projectable future no I won't say that right like just for
39:02
example we are supply constraint this year in our cloud business right and
39:08
when we are all of us are simultaneously looking to scale up data centers right
39:14
so we are running into real constraints the way the constraints play out today is delays in projects because of
39:21
permitting or you know not having access to electricians all of that is realities
39:26
all of us are dealing with right So if this trend line continues the pace at
39:32
which we are all ramping up and obviously for it to continue we all have to generate the returns on it and you
39:38
know and and so it has to really impact the economy in a more substantive way so they go hand in hand uh if the trend
39:45
continues these constraints will be much more visible I think today we are all working through these constraints uh so
39:51
I think there are real constraints today uh but I expect it to for us to be competitive with China etc i think we
39:58
have to solve these constraints in the near future what does that look like then fast forward 15 years the US has
40:06
25% of the electricity of China mhm is China just bigger GDP in that moment is
40:12
the pie going to grow for everyone you know how do we kind of think about how you know the way I've assumed is the US
40:19
is always there's never been a time where US just doesn't meet these moments right so to me I look at it and say it
40:26
just means that you know the capitalist solutions will innovate through this moment right that's why people are
40:32
working hard to build SMRs and uh nuclear fusion etc so I've kind of assumed we will meet that moment and if
40:41
we don't or if if the if the lines don't match I think the conversations will get louder and louder till we meet the
40:47
moment uh that's that's the way I internalize it there's a history of Google investing in innovative
40:52
technologies and being ignored or being told that they don't make much sense
40:58
good luck the TPU is a great example the acquisition of Deep Mind is a great example the investment in infrastructure
41:05
is a great example the insane continued investment forever in Whimo is a great
41:12
example and suddenly it looks like Whimo's on track to be a hundred billion dollar business and this is actually going to work
41:18
mindblowing persistence and patience by the way we have we are doing the same
Google's progress in quantum computing and robotics
41:24
patient approach in many other areas that's my next question quantum is one so tell me about quantum but you know
41:30
but because everyone ignores quantum you've had this investment for some time why is quantum so important because
41:38
again I want to use the historical data that it does it seems like a small bet good luck but what does quantum evolve
41:44
to from a compute perspective for humanity and when does that happen do you think obviously quantum has gotten a
41:49
lot more attention in the last 12 months or so uh but we've been work just like Whimo we work through these things
41:55
whether there's attention from the outside or not because we are working on these things out of conviction on the
42:02
long-term trends right so it's it comes from those first principles um obviously
42:08
the universe is fundamentally quantum uh you know to to do any kind of large scale uh simulations in a way that truly
42:14
represent nature you know you would need uh some versions of quantum computing i think to me quantum feels like where AI
42:23
was around you know 2015 so I would say in a 5-year time
42:32
frame you would have that moment where some a really useful practical
42:38
computation you know is done in a quantum way far superior to classical
42:43
computers and that'll be that aha moment uh you know I think which will really show the promise of the industry
42:50
uh I'm absolutely confident that we will get there when I see the progress and I
42:56
can pattern match to progress in the other fundamental areas we have worked on so it really doesn't feel like
43:03
obviously look these are very challenging areas you may hit a constraint i do think a lot of people are making announcements in quantum so
43:09
in some ways it's tough to distinguish them we had the same scenario in self-driving maybe 3 years ago there
43:15
were so many people doing self-driving it looked like everyone was roughly the same but they weren't uh I
43:22
could internally tell the difference that how far ahead Whimo was i feel that way about our quantum effort too i think
43:28
there are a lot of announcements a lot of noise in the industry there are few good people but like you know you know
43:34
but I I do think we are at the at the frontier there and so you know I'm I'm
43:40
pretty excited about it in a 3 to 5 year time frame but we'll be patient and get there yeah do you want to speculate on a
43:47
business in quantum look I I we are committed to you know in almost all
43:52
these cases our goal would be to you know demonstrate more and more useful
43:59
practical algorithms and show progress on that and and give access to it
44:04
through cloud right and and I think you know I always say it's
44:11
tough to project innovation on top of a platform right nobody could say just because you had smartphones and GPS and
44:17
payments something like Uber would get invented you couldn't linearly sit and project Uber from the underlying
44:24
innovation that's how the world works and so uh for me quantum is that foundational again just like AI there's
44:31
going to be extraordinary innovations on top of it we don't know the algorithms yet it's almost like trying to predict how people would use personal computers
44:37
in 1977 or something that's right we're very early and you know some of the the constraints in quantum are that there
44:44
aren't quantum computers to test them out new algorithms to test them out there's a lot of theory in quantum algorithm development but not a lot of
44:51
testability experimentation at this point we are working on all of that too i think we'll have more exciting moments
44:57
to share this year so look forward to making I think that that's what's interesting it will expand people's minds of the potential of what you can
45:03
actually do right now no one really knows how to think about quantum where it's going to take us but those announcements I think are going to be
45:09
really preient and then I'm assuming all your friends will show up and say "We've got a quantum effort." Now too tell me
45:16
about robotics i think this was going to be the year of the robot we see so many models being trained on simulation data
45:23
or real world kind of observational data that are then being used to control physical systems call it physical AI
45:29
call it robotics lots of startups lots of big companies google bought Boston Dynamics and a bunch of other robotic
45:36
companies i think Andy Rubin was overseeing these for a while and then you sold them off and decided it was too
45:41
early what's your point of view on the opportunity in robotics today how does Google play here we are definitely for
45:48
robotics you know we again have probably you know one of the most advanced frontier R&D teams
45:57
in the world now uh you know and and the Gemini robotics efforts around vision language action models etc are world
46:04
class i do think um you know robotics uh you know so we are now thinking through
46:11
how we either partner or where we actually bring products out you are right we we tried the application layer
46:19
too early uh where I think robotics wasn't really being influenced by AI as
46:25
much but now it's it's really the combination of AI plus robotics that gives that next sweet spot right and and
46:32
so we are uh making plans there uh nothing to share today but you will see us make more announcements in the space
46:39
but we are definitely uh foundationally driving uh the underlying uh models and
46:45
We are building state-of-the-art models there we are working with partners and testing it you know that when I look at
46:52
the progress of humanoid robots etc i mean they are uh you know in the past I
46:58
would say oh these this is obviously uh you know you can see how janky they are
47:04
now I have to take 5 seconds to look at it and say closely and say is this fake or is this an actual robot doing it
47:11
right right like already I'm in that moment and so and so you can see the progress uh in the field underway so I
47:18
think you know we are probably two to three years away from that magical moment in robotics too and so so that's
47:25
the next exciting phase is a good way to think about it that Google could potentially develop the Android for
47:30
robotics and ultimately have a broad play here yeah we have intrinsic so one of our bets is effectively doing that so
47:37
uh supporting uh robotics manufacturers um you know we we are committed to
47:43
having the Gemini as a model you know will will take all modalities into
47:49
account work very very well for robotics it's definitely something we are committed to being on how we actually
47:55
bring products out first party versus third party etc is where we are thinking I want to talk a little bit about
Culture, coddling, and talent recruitment in the age of AI
48:00
culture which seems to be a key differentiator on the kind of competitive landscape I go back to
48:07
thinking about Google offering free food massages at work 20% time as a way to
48:12
attract and win in the early days of the talent wars in Silicon Valley early 2000s and and and that persisted but
48:19
what happened is it grew and it became more amenities and the narrative is that Google ended up creating a culture that
48:26
kind of moved away from more accountability and performance and was much more about coddling employees can
48:33
you just comment on kind of your observations on the evolution of Google over the 20 years that you've been here and what you've tried to do lately as a
48:39
leader how you think about the culture you want to foster and what you're doing about it look I think it's important to
48:45
step back and say you know the underpinnings of a culture in which you really invest in employees and and you
48:52
empower them and and even some of the perks was to create a a a culture where
49:01
it's positive optimistic you're in an innovation mindset people are talking to each other maybe by giving lunch here
49:08
people are all sitting and talking ideas through lunch you're cross-pollinating imagine so you know that is the thesis
49:14
of it not that we are trying to give lunch to people right and and so I till
49:20
today feel you know we still get a lot of innovation in the company at all
49:26
levels of the company and I think people wake up um you know and say well I can
49:31
go do this notebook LM etc are great examples right and so people do that all the time so I think empowering
49:38
employees has been and is and will be a source of strength for Google right I think we can attract higher caliber
49:45
people who feel like they have agency to do that right and but that doesn't mean
49:51
like you know I think I think people shouldn't confuse that with like today for example you can take something like Google deep mind I think there is all
49:58
the way from Demis and others you know extraordinary leadership team be korai Jeff Oral no me etc all these leaders
50:05
have strong opinions depends on how to drive that frontier forward and and that's happening too right so I think
50:12
it's important to strike a balance balance uh between the two I think when you empower employees a lot in some ways
50:19
like you know we have allowed for more free speech than other companies that's one way you can think about it so you're going to hear voices sometimes you can
50:27
hear like what is effectively 500 people in the company but that doesn't
50:32
represent the company as a whole so in some ways we are different from other companies and can confuse use it on the outside I think but I think overall look
50:40
we have a clear sense of where we are going I think we want to empower people
50:45
all in the service of our mission so if anything you know over the past few years and you are right there are moments not just us but as an industry I
50:54
think uh I think some of the other things became more of the focus than the
50:59
mission of the company and why we are all here right like we are we are not all here in the company to resolve all
51:06
our personal differences or something we are here because you're excited about you know innovating in the service
51:13
of the mission of the company and and the impact you can have and so bringing that focus back that's something I've
51:18
been very deliberate about for for the past few years and I think it needs reinforcing i think one of the lessons
51:24
for me was we all grew so much that you assumed everyone always understood those
51:31
underpinnings but then when you added so many people you realize you have to go back and repeat that a lot uh to to help
51:39
people internalize that we've done that and we do that all the time uh I think
51:44
moments like this help a lot too the current moment is just genuinely both so
51:49
exciting and so intense it actually reminds me a lot of early Google right you know when I walk into the GDM
51:57
building you know some of our earliest engineers are all sitting there working
52:03
together people come in 5 days a week at a minimum right and so you have that
52:09
intensity and you have that excitement and I feel that same sense of optimism so that's what I'm focused on right you
52:15
know to me that's the hardcordness which matters right like are people smart
52:20
people really working with a passion and that's where that intensity comes from
52:26
and and you have to work hard to create that and you know there are pockets of the company if that doesn't happen you
52:31
figure out what are the changes you need to make uh to to do that right and
52:36
sometimes for example I recreated the notion of labs right and and and because I said
52:43
well there are things that are possible with 10erson teams and so we need go and
52:49
do that again and and there are quite a few projects both we have shipping and
52:54
are underway to come which will be an outcome of those efforts as well so you know your culture your values are
53:00
enduring culture is something you're constantly tweaking to make sure you're true to your values and so by definition
53:07
there's going to be drift and you know you work hard to uh uh snap it back was
53:13
there a moment in the last 10 years where you said I've got to spend more time on this oh you know uh for sure i
53:20
look I think CO was such a big distortion to to the to our way of working right so you know fundamentally
53:27
Google was designed to be uh a culture in which people were seeing each other
53:32
engaging with each other so losing that continuity right I I think definitely
53:38
impacted our culture so when we have we've gotten people back uh in a 3-2
53:43
model and some teams are you know work uh beyond that I think it's been
53:48
important I've I've spent time to get those connections back like you know for example GDM we were intentional in
53:54
creating a physical space where we can get all of them back in the same building both in London both in Mountain
54:02
View and and and taking our newest building um you know with that kind of a
54:08
tentlike roof structure and putting all the people in and being intentional about it has made a massive difference
54:15
have you found a shift in your ability to recruit top talent a lot of great talent has started other great companies
54:23
other great companies in Silicon Valley have recruited folks i know there's always a talent war going on but has
54:29
there been a tenor shift for Google in the last period of time because of some of the underlying advantages in AI or
54:35
some of the cultural changes that are underway the talent market you know we
54:40
go through these fierce moments for talent AI is one of them and whenever there are these Google you know
54:47
obviously we we are fortunate to have some of the most talented employees so we are a source I'm equally proud of the
54:53
fact that I think Googleers have left to start over 2,000 companies right and and so you know there is a virtuous cycle I
55:00
think people come back we acquire companies I think all of that keeps the company uh fresh but in the current AI
55:07
moment Look I think we are both holding on to critical talent we are recruiting you know I always look at the tip of the
55:13
tree of are we able to attract the best PhD researchers coming out of the top
55:19
programs and the answer is yes um you know and and there are people who have left who have come back and so I feel
55:26
good about the position we are but you work at it hard every week every month and so on do you think this is going to
55:31
change in the future with how we do education and how AI plays a role in
55:37
education are you going to be able to identify recruit and then teach and
55:42
train talent out of high schools and at an earlier age and the traditional kind of college education system is going to
55:48
change because of AI on the job training there's a lot of potential to change i
55:53
just there's a part of me which feels maybe we've all misunderstood what colleges are about and maybe colleges
55:58
are about that community and people getting together and exchanging so it
56:05
you know there may be intangibles which which would still uh maybe make the uh
56:10
uh uh you know it more valuable than like we all perceive it to be but um but
56:16
the way I think about it is you're going to get extraordinary talent at more places around the world so that's the
56:23
way I think about it because people have access to with AI so you don't need to
56:28
be in a few certain places to be that uh that great uh great talent so I think
56:34
the nature of that changes by the way I think it's an important thing to internalize we often talk about talent we've always been able to recruit the
56:41
best talent uh in the country but now there's extraordinary talent emerging in
56:46
other parts of the world too so I think it's something not to lose uh line of sight and you know maybe that's the way
Does he consider Alphabet a holding company searching for Google's next $100B business?
56:53
I would think about it so just taking a step back zooming back I had a conversation 10 years ago with Larry
56:58
Paige where he talked about the transition from Google to Alphabet alphabet is going to be this holding company it's going to discover or
57:05
develop the next hundred billion dollar revenue business at the time I think Google wasn't quite at hundred billion
57:10
there have been a lot of these investments and other bets since that time do you still think about Alphabet
57:16
as a holding company are there still multiple businesses that you want to
57:21
kind of stand up and foster and have this kind of holding company model is that still hold or is Google really the
57:29
core engine that's going to continue to evolve and continue to have ancillary businesses that are you know somewhat
57:35
adjacent to Google i'll answer it two ways right so I think the way we are not
57:41
a holding company in the sense that we are we are not just like looking to invest capital in other attractive
57:48
businesses that's that's not who we are right uh we are you know from a
57:54
foundational technology basis if you can take that technology and that R&D we do and
58:01
identify problems in which we can innovate and bring a differentiated value proposition we'll do do that right
58:08
so that's the way we approach and so the the structure is an outcome of that right
58:13
so and which means you will have businesses uh on on on on paper they may
58:20
look like very desperate but there's a common strand underneath them right so like mayo is going to keep getting
58:28
better because of the same work we do in Gemini and AI over time as Google cloud
58:34
to search to YouTube to isomorphic to robotics etc so that is the unifying
58:40
layer right and and then it's a continuum is Google cloud a Google
58:45
business or an alphabet business right you know we segment it out right and so
58:51
uh so you know so the the the branding matters less I think right you know we'll have a range of companies some of
58:57
them will leave and IPO out because maybe that's the best way they can make progress so all of that is a possibility
59:04
but what I think I founders think about is like the underlying innovation by
59:11
which so we think at the units of quantum right you know alpha fold and
59:17
hence isomorphic right you know self-driving and and building the way more driver and hence all the businesses
59:23
on top of it so it's more maybe maybe that's how we think about it right does X still play a big role in driving
59:30
innovation and you continue to invest there yeah look I think if anything um X over time look a lot of lot of these
59:37
innovations did that come out of X right and so um including Whimo uh you know
59:43
the early incarnations of Google Brain right yeah so so I think uh X as an
59:48
incubator um allows us to uh you know push the boundaries they're thinking
59:54
about uh tapestries thinking about the grid problem um that are uh you know uh
1:00:02
extraordinary but but it's all rooted in computer science physics kind of a deep
1:00:08
uh technology R&D and I think that's the foundation across everything we do as we wrap up um I want to ask you one last
1:00:14
question to hopefully frame your experience of the last 10 years as a CEO
1:00:20
biggest regret biggest mistake and what you're most proud of proud is obvious
1:00:26
look I I think I think we have as a company I think there aren't that many companies which can push the technology
1:00:32
frontier like you don't hear of companies winning Nobel prizes often that level of foundational R&D we do and
1:00:39
then apply it to create businesses and value i think I think we've done an
1:00:44
extraordinary job at that and we aspire to do that you know I'm I'm really proud of that i think we're pretty unique as a
1:00:50
company that way you know there a lot of small regrets you know by nature i tend to look forward and I learn from
1:00:57
mistakes we make but look there are acquisitions we debated hard came close
1:01:03
and you know some of them are just give me one name
1:01:10
or get in trouble maybe Netflix right like we debated Netflix at some point super intensely inside so you go through
1:01:16
these moments right and and uh and uh you know and so uh I wouldn't call it
1:01:22
regrets but you always look back and like you know like you know in in a world of butterfly effects there were alternate paths but maybe they are in a
1:01:29
different part of the multiverse yes yes i always um tell people I I think they
1:01:35
underappreciate the role that Bell Labs played in driving innovation and
1:01:41
ultimately human prosperity in the early 20th century and I do think a lot of people underappreciate the role that
1:01:46
Alphabet is playing in driving innovation across so many different lanes which drives prosperity businesses
1:01:54
competition all that stuff aside the innovation that's being driven out of Alphabet continues to impress and
1:02:00
benefit us all and so I want to thank you for your leadership and the time thanks David real pleasure
1:02:10
[Music] i'm going all in
