CNBC Television 
3.1 M

0:00
if everyone will please take their seats
0:11
now this is my u this is my 60th annual meeting and
0:20
uh and it's the biggest and I think it'll be the best yet and uh I would uh
0:27
before I start I'd like to give you a few figures from from uh yesterday
0:34
because we set all kinds of records uh yesterday we had
0:39
uh um
0:45
19,700 people that joined us in the afternoon between noon and 5:00 and that
0:53
was up from 16,200 which was a previous record the year before
1:00
uh and uh in every aspect we set records uh
1:08
sees Candy did uh uh
1:13
$317,000 against 283,000 the year before and most of these were limited by
1:20
capacity i mean there were there were lines there throughout the total day brooks did
1:26
310,000 uh it was an all-time record sales day for them and I think they have
1:33
close to 3,000 runners lined up for Sunday uh which is a lot of people to
1:38
get up that I I think we we've had 2200 or 2400 before but but 3,000 and uh that
1:47
doesn't count me and it won't count me and uh I could go up and down the
1:54
line jazz Jazz wares uh
2:00
um around 250,000 double the previous years they they just sell as fast as
2:05
they can sell most of most every every place had had uh had uh people lined up
2:11
at the uh at the cash register sometimes for a
2:16
lot longer wait than wish we had but uh but we'll learn the game
2:22
eventually and it goes on and on every company set records and uh and
2:29
uh there's no way of knowing how many people we have here today we have people
2:35
listening in around the world uh but
2:40
uh uh I think we're setting we'll probably set records in a great variety
2:46
of ways and uh I would uh we're going to
2:52
have in a minute we'll get to the question and answer but I' I'd like to
2:57
first introduce our directors and and uh
3:02
uh I'm I'm Warren Buffett and I was born and bred right here in Omaha
3:14
uh we have Greg Ael he was born and bread in
3:21
Canada and we have a Jeep Jane who was born and bread in India so
3:30
we we have a very diverse group and uh
3:36
uh in the audience and I will introduce them alphabetically and if they'll stand
3:44
as I introduce them and uh I know it'll be an effort but withhold your applause
3:50
till the end so that uh so that we can get through the list but we'll
3:56
alphabetically uh with Howard Buffett how I would just stand and
4:02
uh withhold the applause it'll go to his head uh Susan
4:09
Buffett we have Steve
4:14
Burke Ken Chanel Chris
4:20
Davis Sue Decker who's our lead director Charlotte
4:27
Gman Tom Murphy Jr Ron Olsen and I'll have a few and
4:34
when we finish I'll have a few more things to add about him wally
4:40
Whites and Mel Whitmer and with that you've got our all-star
4:52
cast and Ron if you don't mind standing I would like to point out that that Ron
4:59
they finally got through an age director thing at at Birkshire uh I think we had
5:05
five that were over 90 here not too long ago but uh but we put in the highest
5:11
uh or Sue tells me anyway that it's the the highest age uh uh limit that any any
5:21
of the companies she checked out came up with but uh uh Ron has been on the board
5:28
for 28 years and uh been associated with
5:33
Charlie Munger at Munger Tolls for many years beyond that and has been around at
5:42
a variety of times of crisis and joy and disappointments and surprises and
5:48
everything else at Bergkshire and has been of invaluable help to us so I think
5:55
I think I'd like to give a special hand to Ron [Applause]
6:09
Olsson and uh I think I'll do something else that isn't done usually at annual
6:14
meetings but I I haven't had a chance uh
6:19
I listened to them on Thursday afternoon it's the only It's the only
6:24
uh It's the only investment quarterly call that I listen
6:30
to but uh I listen to Tim Cook and I understand and it'll be tough for me to
6:35
see him from up here but Tim Cook there he is
6:47
i'm somewhat embarrassed to say that Tim Cook has made the Bergkshire a lot more money than I've ever made Berkshire
6:54
so I uh credit credit should be given to
6:59
him for uh I knew Steve Jobs briefly and Steve of course did things that nobody
7:06
else could have done in developing Apple but but
7:12
uh Steve picked out Tim to succeed him and he really made the right decision
7:18
steve died young as you know and uh nobody but Steve could have created
7:26
Apple but nobody could but but Tim could have developed it like it has so so on
7:32
behalf of all of Bergkshire thank you
7:41
Tim there's a couple other people I'd like to thank uh I don't do any work in terms of the
7:49
show or anything else around Bergkshire but uh what you see today
7:55
uh is the product of a lot of people at Berkshire they forget you know that they
8:02
don't think of themselves as the one who's supposed to screw a light in and leave for somebody else specialist to
8:10
come along and do other things uh the people of Bergkshire put on this this
8:15
show every year and uh uh you know our
8:20
our chief financial officer and just everybody pitches in it's a remarkable
8:26
organization that way but it's led this year uh in the last few years by Melissa
8:34
Shapiro and she's made this whole thing work melissa
8:47
And then we got an idea a while back well many years ago
8:53
uh well I'll take it all the way back uh maybe
8:59
uh 65 years ago I met uh Carrie
9:05
Sa's grandfather and uh wife they had nine children and Susie
9:14
and I joined a a um playhouse group and I don't look like
9:22
the kind of guy that would join a playhouse group but it was turned out to be a great a great move in many ways
9:27
first of all I enjoyed the plays uh but beyond that uh
9:33
uh I met not only uh not not
9:39
only Carrie's grandfather who ran an insurance company in Omaha Bill Kaiser
9:46
uh but I uh also met uh the Blumpin boys
9:53
uh parents Louie and and Francis so in in one sort
10:00
of accident um when I was in my 20s uh came up with
10:06
all kinds of good things and in connection with Carrie her father ran a company called
10:15
uh Central States and later on we bought that company and then her
10:21
father ran the company her sister went to work for
10:28
Bergkshire some years ago and then uh she decided to have a family and
10:34
subsequently had four kids so she left but Carrie moved right in and Carrie uh
10:43
uh had amazing talents behind just like a good many people do they they they
10:50
have talents you don't you don't realize till uh you give them some responsibility and
10:57
so 10 or 11 years ago at uh I asked Carrie to do a 50th anniversary book
11:05
uh about Bergkshire and just use her imagination and and she never she didn't need to
11:12
check with me or do anything she just she'd never edited a book she'd never published a book she'd never dealt with
11:18
the printers before but she just went out and promptly put together this 50th
11:24
anniversary book and then this year uh well then Carrie of course got
11:31
married and had three kids so she had to leave us but but uh and we have a we go
11:38
to a baseball game once a year and we invite some of our distinguished alumni like Carrie to join us and uh Carrie uh
11:48
uh even though she was raising three children
11:54
uh and you may have met one or two of them uh in the last day or so she
12:01
volunteered to bring bring together a 60th anniversary book and uh which I I
12:08
asked for and uh again she took the whole thing she just did it uh she kept
12:14
doing the things with her kids and every now and then she'd I'd ask her how it was going and she'd tell me how it was
12:20
going and so she put together this 60th anniversary book and um
12:27
um got it done by you know maybe a week before the meeting because I I gave her
12:33
the assignment very late and uh yesterday we
12:41
sold I think it was 4,000 plus 4 to 4,500 maybe we we
12:47
4,400 uh we printed 8,000 we intended to print 5,000
12:53
but so we sold 4,400 books
12:59
yesterday and uh we'll have 30 I guess
13:04
roughly 3,600 left out there today and it's kind
13:10
of a whimsical and but but accurate and uh uh
13:18
uh she came out with just the book I hope she would come out with and uh and
13:24
then as we went through uh this publishing experience
13:31
uh Carrie wouldn't take a dime um but I
13:37
did get her to name her uh favorite charity and this statement center which
13:45
takes care of homeless people uh and does a great many other things uh
13:51
it's located about five or six miles from where we are here south has been doing a
13:59
wonderful job her grandfather helped form it uh her husband's now joined the
14:07
board and uh we are selling 20 copies of uh this
14:13
is a commercial place isn't it we are selling a uh 20 copies that uh we sold
14:20
10 prior to the meeting that's all we let them sell and we raised a few
14:27
hundred,000 doing that uh I think we sold one for
14:33
$100,000 and um but we limited that to 10 and the
14:42
only difference in these and the $25 version is that uh Carrie and I sound
14:48
signed them uh but we saved six for yesterday and uh
14:55
the six brought $148,000 which is a pretty good average
15:01
per book of about 20
15:07
odd,000 and I then I had him say four more so uh this afternoon when we
15:12
disband at 1:00 uh the uh area right behind us that has
15:19
all the goods in it in the bookstore uh they will sell the final four and
15:26
when we get all through I'll match whatever we've raised for the the 20 and uh and we'll give the uh Steven Center
15:35
a boost both in financially but also in awareness uh so anyway
15:42
[Applause] that and when you look at that
15:49
book Carrie really did the whole thing i mean there's a lot of information in there she dug through it and and she
15:57
came through a couple times maybe to check a fact or two but she she she got all she got material from the Munger
16:04
family she she just did a wonderful job and and and uh I I I I couldn't get her to take a
16:12
penny for it so I'm going to ask her to do a lot of other things in the future
16:17
but okay uh with that I think we've
16:23
we've covered all the the business so uh we will move
16:31
to Becky questions that she's received from I don't know how many she's
16:36
received but from all over the country and perhaps outside the country and
16:42
she's picked out a group of them which uh she has not shared with me uh and uh
16:51
we will alternate questions between Becky and uh
16:58
the audience which we have by zones and and uh and with that I will
17:04
uh turn things over Becky for the first question thanks Warren um this first cut question
17:11
comes from Bill Mitchell i received more questions about this than any other question he writes "Warren in a 2003
17:19
Fortune article you argued for import certificates to limit trade deficits and
17:24
said these import certificates basically amounted to a tariff but recently you
17:30
called tariffs an act of economic war has your view on trade barriers changed
17:35
or do you see import certificates as somehow distinct from tariffs?" Yeah
17:41
well the import certificates were distinct but they they their goal was to
17:47
balance u imports against exports and so that
17:53
the trade deficit would not grow in an enormous way in fact it
17:59
would have and it had various other provisions in it to to help uh
18:06
uh third world countries as that time as they were called to perhaps catch up a
18:11
little bit uh and they they had a variety of aspects to them but basically they were designed to balance trade and
18:20
uh I think you can make some very good arguments for the fact that balanced
18:25
trade is good for the world and the more balanced trade there is the better it
18:31
will continue to be better for cocoa to be raged in Ghana and coffee and
18:37
Colombia and a few things and and over time the
18:44
uh American industry has gone from being an agricultural country this was
18:51
this was nothing but an egg country i mean that uh virtually uh and that was
18:56
only 250 years ago and we have become a very industrial country and uh we did
19:04
not want to make that a situation uh in my view uh where we ran uh greater
19:12
and greater deficits building up greater and greater debts against the country so I I designed this uh import certificate
19:21
thing which uh Charlie thought was a little rub too much like Rub Goldberg i
19:26
don't know whether that time name is but it's gimmicky but uh it's certainly a
19:33
lot better than anything I I think than we're talking about now and there's no question that
19:40
trade trade can be an act of war and uh
19:46
and I think it's led to bad things just the attitudes it's brought
19:52
out uh in the United States i mean we should
19:57
be looking to trade with the rest of the world and we should do what we do best and they should do what they do best and
20:04
uh I don't think
20:12
it that's that's what we did originally i mean we were good at producing tobacco and cotton uh uh 250 years ago and we
20:22
and we traded it and uh uh we want a
20:27
prosperous world uh with eight countries with nuclear weapons including a few that are
20:35
what I would call quite unstable i do not think it's a great idea to try and
20:40
design a world where a few countries say "Haha we've won." And uh uh other
20:48
countries uh are envious [Applause]
20:55
so so my my import certificate idea which went no place uh uh I think we've
21:03
got extra copies with not a great demand for the copies uh if
21:09
anybody and if you'd like and write the office I think we could we could probably send you a copy of it but the
21:16
main thing to do is not use trade should not be a weapon and the United
21:24
States United States we've won i mean we have become an incredibly important
21:30
country starting from nothing 250 years ago there's nothing been anything like it
21:37
and it's a big mistake in my view when you
21:42
have 7 12 billion people that uh don't
21:48
like you very well and you got 300 million that are crowing in some way about how well they've done and uh uh I
21:57
don't think it's right and I don't think it's wise uh I do think that the
22:03
more the more the more prosperous the rest of the world becomes it won't be at our expense the more prosperous we'll
22:10
become and with and the the the safer we'll feel and your children will feel someday uh so
22:23
that's but don't ex don't expect my import certificate idea to go to up down there with Adam Smith's wealth of
22:30
nations or anything okay uh let's go
22:37
to area
22:43
one mr buffett U Mr abel and Mr jane
22:49
good morning uh I'm St j i'm from Hong Kong mr buffett and Mr monger did a very
22:58
good and successful investment in Japan in the past five or six years the recent
23:06
CPI in Japan is currently above
23:11
3% not far away from its 2% targets bank
23:17
of Japan seems very determined in raising rates while Fed ECB and other
23:25
central banks are considering to cut them do you think BOJ Bank of Japan
23:33
makes sense to proceed the rate hike will is planned rate hike deter you from
23:41
further investing Japanese stock market or even considering to realize your
23:48
current profits thank you very much for arranging this greatest event every year
23:56
finally I wish you healthy always and keep holding this
24:03
shareholding thank
24:10
you well I'm going to extend the same goodwill to Japan that you've just
24:15
extended to me i I I I let the people of Japan determine
24:21
their best course of action in terms of economics it's it's an
24:28
incredible story uh and uh uh five it's
24:33
been about six years now as you pointed out i was just going through a little handbook
24:39
uh that probably had two or three thousand Japanese companies in it um one
24:47
problem I have is that I can't read that handbook anymore the the print's too small but uh the uh and here were these
24:56
five trading companies they have a special name for them in Japan but they
25:02
were selling at ridiculously low prices and uh so I spent
25:09
about a year acquiring them and then we got to know the people better and everything that Greg and I saw we like
25:15
better as we went along so we got fairly close to the 10% limit that we we told
25:24
the companies we would never exceed without their permission and uh so we
25:29
did ask them reasonably whether that limit could be relaxed and it's in the
25:36
process of being relaxed somewhat um
25:42
we I I would I would say that I'll speak for Greg beyond me that I in the next 50
25:50
years uh and I hope he's running things uh we we won't give a thought to to
25:57
selling those i mean they had uh uh and uh Japan's
26:04
record has been extraordinary actually in terms of that uh uh my guess is that Tim would tell
26:12
you Tim Cook would tell you that iPhone sales there are about as great as any
26:19
country outside the United States american Express would tell you that they sell their product very very well
26:27
in Japan coca-cola that we do business with another big investment of ours they do
26:34
extraordinarily well in Japan they have a number of habits in uh in a
26:39
civilization that operates differently than ours uh Japan is by far the biggest
26:46
uh they this is the container they've always preferred
26:53
uh for soft drinks and and they have uh they have a whole different sort of
26:59
distribution system there but we have been treated extremely well by the five
27:05
companies they they they talked with Greg primarily uh I went over there year
27:13
or two ago but uh Greg Greg's Greg's more cosmopolitan than I
27:20
am so he's he'sn't saying much actually but uh very
27:26
little and but he is I don't How many times do you think
27:34
you've met with representatives of one company the other yeah when you think of the five there's definitely a couple
27:40
meetings a year Warren and I think the thing we're building with the five five
27:45
companies is one it's it's been a very good investment but we are really as Warren touched on we we envision holding
27:52
the investment for 50 years or or forever but I think we also are building
27:58
relationships to do incremental things with each of those companies and we really do hope to do big things with
28:04
them uh globally they bring different perspectives and different opportunities and we see and that's the uh that's why
28:11
we're building that long-term relationship with them it's super long-term and and and they have a much
28:18
they have a they have different customs they have different uh approaches to
28:24
business that's that's true around the world and uh and uh we're we we don't have any
28:33
intention in any way of trying to change what they've done because do because
28:38
they they do it very successfully and uh and our our
28:44
our main activity is just to is just to cheer and clap and uh and that I can
28:52
still do it 94 uh so uh we will own
28:58
[Applause] those you know we we will
29:06
uh we we will not be selling any stock i mean that is just it's that that will
29:12
not happen uh in in decades if then uh and I my
29:20
guess is that they will find things because they cover the world pretty much
29:25
uh the five trading companies we will find things occasionally
29:32
that may be very large for any individual company there
29:39
uh they may in some way be assisted by some some help we bring to the situation
29:48
uh but but that will be an expanding relationship uh it's too bad that
29:56
Bergkshire has gotten as big as it is because we love that position and I'd
30:01
like it to be a lot larger than than it is that even with the five companies being they're very large companies and
30:08
they're large companies in Japan uh and we've got at market that you know in the in
30:18
the range of $20 billion invested but I'd rather I'd rather have a hundred
30:24
billion than 20 billion and that's the way I feel about several other investments we have but uh size is an
30:32
enemy uh a performance at Bergkshire and
30:39
uh I don't know any good way to solve
30:45
that problem but but uh Charlie always told me that having a few problems was good for me i never quite understood
30:51
that but he if you listen to I moralize you would
30:57
understand and uh and and it's not an impossible problem at all that uh and
31:04
the Japan the Japan investment is has just been right up our alley you want to
31:10
add anything on that no I think uh you've touched it but
31:16
um as you said it's right up our alley and I I absolutely agree Warren i I do
31:22
believe we'll see some very large opportunities long term and that and that's just been a great plus of that
31:28
that relationship yeah yeah i would say they they they want to they would like
31:34
to present us with opportunities we would like to receive them we've got the
31:39
money we both get along well very well with each other and they have different
31:45
they have some different customs than than we have uh they drink the number
31:51
one Coca-Cola product they drink over there something called Georgia coffee uh so uh I'm I'm I haven't converted them
31:59
to Cherry Coke and they're not going to convert me to Georgia coffee but it's it's a perfect
32:07
relationship i just wish we had could get more like it uh uh and I never
32:14
dreamt of that when I picked up that little wasn't so little was about that thick
32:20
but sometimes two companies to a page and and a couple thousand pages I
32:26
believe but it's amazing what you can find when you just turn turn the page
32:33
we showed a movie last year that uh about turn every
32:39
page and I would say that turning every page
32:45
uh is one important ingredient to bring to the investment field that uh and that
32:55
very few people do turn every page and the ones who turn every page aren't going to tell you what they're finding
33:02
so you you got to do a little of it yourself okay
33:08
uh Becky this next question comes from Advate
33:13
Prasad in New York he writes "Today Berkshire holds over $300 billion in
33:19
cash and short-term investments representing about 27% of total assets a
33:26
historically high figure compared to the 13% average over the last 25 years this
33:32
has also led Berkshire to effectively own nearly 5% of the entire US Treasury
33:37
market beyond the need for liquidity to meet insurance obligations is the
33:42
decision to raise cash primarily a d-risking strategy in response to high market
33:48
valuations or is it also a deliberate effort to position Birkshshire's balance sheet for a smooth smoother leadership
33:55
transition providing Greg Ael with maximum flexibility and a clean slate
34:00
for future capital allocation decisions and I will add one line from another
34:05
shareholder Mike Conway who asks "Are you encouraged you may see some fat pitches coming your way?" Yeah
34:14
well I wouldn't do anything nearly so noble as to withhold investing myself
34:20
just so that Greg could look good later on
34:27
[Applause] now if he if he gets any edge what I
34:33
believe I'll resent it so the uh now the the amount of cash we have
34:41
is we we we would spend well we came pretty close to spending 10
34:47
billion not that long ago for example but we'd spend a hundred billion i mean
34:53
and and those decisions are not tough to make uh when when something is offered
35:00
that is that uh makes sense to us and that we understand and uh offers good
35:09
value and where we don't worry about losing and the one problem with the
35:15
investment business is that things don't come along in an
35:20
orderly fashion and they never will i mean it isn't like every day uh you know
35:27
the the long-term record is sensational but that is not a product and I've been
35:32
in let's see I've had um 200 trading
35:37
days times 80 years and yeah at
35:45
uh 16 million trading days it been we kind of uh uh I mean 16,000 trading days
35:53
it it would be nice if every day you got four opportunities or something like
35:59
that and you know you could and they were expected to be equally attractive you know if I if I was
36:06
running a numbers racket you know every day would have the same expectancy of that I would
36:13
keep 40% of whatever the handle was and so the only question would be is how much we transacted but we're not running
36:20
that kind of a business and so we're running a business which is very very very
36:27
opportunistic and uh Charlie always thought I did too many
36:32
things uh he thought if we did about five things in our lifetime we we could
36:38
we could uh we'd end up doing better than if we did 50 and and uh and that we
36:45
never concentrated enough uh so that we would rather
36:52
have if we've got 335 billion now in treasuries we would rather have
37:00
conditions that have developed where we would have like 50 billion or something like that but that that just isn't the
37:06
way the business works and we have made a lot of money by not
37:13
wanting to be fully invested at all times and uh
37:19
um we don't think it's improper actually for people who are passive
37:25
investors just to make a few simple investments and sit with their life uh sit for their
37:32
life and them but we've made the decision to be in the
37:38
business so uh we think we can do a little better than
37:43
that by behaving in a very irregular manner but if you told me that I had to
37:50
invest uh well our let's say that we have a
37:56
roughly 40 billion a year coming in and we start with 335 if you told me I had
38:02
to invest 50 billion every year till we got down to 50 billion that would be the
38:09
dumbest thing in the world to invest in that manner things
38:15
get extraordinarily attractive very occasionally the long-term trend is up
38:23
nobody knows and uh I certainly don't know greg
38:28
doesn't know ajet doesn't know nobody knows what the market is going to do tomorrow next week next month and nobody
38:35
knows what business is going to do tomorrow next week or next month but they spend all their time talking about
38:40
it because it's it's easy to talk about and uh but
38:46
it it it has no value uh I've never found anybody I wanted to listen to on
38:52
the subject and uh the on the other hand I found the leafing through things like
38:58
that big Japanese book that I can't read anymore uh the uh it's it's a that's a
39:06
treasure hunt and every now and then you find something and
39:12
occasionally very occasionally but it'll happen again that uh I don't know
39:18
when it won't it could be next week it could be 5 years off but it won't be 50
39:24
years off he will have we will be bombarded with offerings that that uh
39:32
we'll be glad we have the cash for and it'd be a lot more fun if it would happen tomorrow but it's very unlikely
39:38
to happen tomorrow very very unlikely to happen tomorrow but it's not unlikely to
39:44
happen in five years and then it gets the probabilities get higher as you go along it's kind of like death i mean if
39:51
you're 10 years old the chances that you're going to die the next day are low get to be
39:56
115 or something like that it's almost a cinch uh particularly if you're a male i mean
40:04
all the records are held by females in terms of age and uh I tried to get Charlie to have a sex
40:11
change so he could test out whether and
40:17
[Applause] uh he did pretty well for being a male i'll put it that
40:23
way okay station
40:30
station
40:36
two good morning Warren Greg and Ajit my name is Jackie Han I'm from China and
40:42
now work in Toronto Canada this is my eighth Birkshshire hustling meetings at this point I've probably spent more time
40:49
with you than most people spend on Netflix as you might guess coming from a Chinese family we always had a soft spot
40:57
for real estate so the your question isn't why don't you own a house it's why
41:02
are you still buying stocks instead of more property so here is my question with today's high interest rates and
41:09
global uncertainty do you still believe in being greedy when others are fearful
41:14
or the value investing facing new challenges in today's environment thank
41:20
you yeah well in respect to real estate it's so much harder than
41:29
stocks in terms of uh negotiation of deals time
41:34
spent the involvement of multiple parties in the ownership usually when
41:39
when when real estate gets in trouble you find out you're dealing with more than the equity holder uh uh but there
41:48
have been times when uh large amounts of real estate
41:56
uh have changed hands at bargain prices but usually stocks were cheaper but they were a lot easier to do so
42:04
uh Charlie did more real estate charlie enjoyed real estate transactions
42:11
uh and and he actually did a fair number of them in the last 5 years of his life
42:19
uh but he was you know he was playing a game that it was an interesting game to
42:24
him uh but I think if he you'd asked him to make a choice when he was 21 and he
42:31
had to either be in stocks exclusively the rest of his life or real estate the
42:37
rest of his life he would have chose the stocks of the second the there's just so much more
42:44
opportunity at least in the United States there's so much more opportunity that presents
42:51
itself in the security market and does
42:56
in real estate and in real estate you're dealing with a usually dealing with a
43:02
single owner or a family that owns maybe a large property they've had a long time
43:08
maybe they've borrowed too much of money against it maybe the population trends are against them but but to them it's an
43:15
enormous decision when you walk down to the New York Stock Exchange you can do
43:20
billions of dollars worth of business totally anonymous and you can do it in 5 minutes and the trades are complete when
43:26
they're complete in real estate when you make a deal a big deal with a distress
43:32
lender you know when you sign the deal then you go into another phase i mean
43:38
then people start negotiating more things and more things and it's it's it's a whole different game and a
43:45
different type of person to some extent enjoys the game uh
43:51
uh we uh we we did a few real estate
43:56
deals that came our way in 2008 and nine but but the the amount of time that they
44:05
would take us compared to doing something intelligent and probably
44:11
better uh and securities uh there was just no comparison i mean
44:18
in a real estate deal every every sentence is as important to the person and and in stocks
44:26
uh if somebody needs to sell 20,000 shares of Berkshire or something and they call us and the price is right it's
44:32
done in 5 seconds and and it closes all the time that uh uh people who you
44:40
certainly wouldn't want to have marry your daughter or they behave well actually
44:47
um in in in in socks partly that's because that they're probably having
44:53
their their wires or phones or whatever it is uh recorded as to what they've
44:59
said and everything but but the the completion rate for working on anything
45:07
in stocks is if assuming you're got a meeting of the minds on prices
45:13
essentially 100% in real estate it just begins when you agree on deals and then
45:20
they take forever so that for a guy 94 it's it's not it's not at the most
45:26
interesting thing to get involved in something where the where the negotiations could take years uh and
45:34
uh we we have the capability there have been some huge
45:40
failures in in in fact it uh if you go all the way back to
45:46
Zechonorf in the 1960s he was going to change the world and Century City out in California is a product of his and and
45:54
if you go to uh Urus if you go
45:59
to he was sitting on top of the world with the earth buildings and uh
46:05
so people tend to get in trouble in that business uh the banks usually don't want to
46:12
recognize it but that takes a long time to go through the through the bank processes they just got through
46:20
redoing the Musk cologne that he made when he was buying it three years ago uh
46:27
uh the company that's now X and you know 3 years to work out a transaction that
46:36
uh or you've got parties on both sides that aren't ready to act that we find it
46:41
much better when people are just ready to pick up the phone and you can do
46:47
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business in the day i've been spoiled but I like being spoiled so we'll keep
46:54
it that way okay Becky
47:00
um this question comes from Sam England in San Francisco and it's for Warren and A as
47:08
AI systems become more capable and harder to interpret how do you see that
47:13
affecting the insurance industry's ability to assess price and transfer risk are there parallels to past
47:21
disruptions Bergkshire has navigated in underwriting or capital allocation
47:26
okay Becky and G's got about a 100 points of IQ on me and he's just going to be here this morning so I'm going to
47:33
let him answer the question first well uh there is no question in my mind that
47:40
AI is going to be a real gamecher and it's going to change the way we assess
47:46
risk we price risk we sell the risk and then the way we end up paying claims
47:53
having said that I certainly also feel that people end up spending enormous
48:00
amount of money trying to chase the next new new fashionable thing we uh are not
48:08
very good in terms of being the being the fastest or the first mover our approach is more to wait and see until
48:14
the opportunity crystallizes and we have a better point of view in terms of risk of failure upside downside so right now
48:23
the individual insurance operations do dabble in AI and try and figure out what
48:28
is the best way to exploit it but we have not yet made a conscious big-time
48:34
effort in terms of pouring a lot of money into this opportunity and my guess
48:39
is we will be in a state of readiness and should that opportunity pop up we'll
48:45
be in a state where we'll jump in promptly yeah and I was just add I wouldn't
48:53
trade I wouldn't trade everything that's developed in AI in the next 10 years for for a G so if you gave me a
49:01
choice that uh uh gave me a choice
49:08
of having a hundred billion dollars available to participate in the
49:15
insurance property casualty insurance business for the next 10 years and I had a choice of getting the top AI product
49:24
out of whoever's whoever's developing it or having a Jeep making the decision i
49:29
would I would take a Jeep [Applause]
49:39
anytime and I'm not kidding about that okay station three
49:50
hello I'm Sean Seagull from Chicago Illinois thank you for investing your
49:55
time to you and the executive committee for putting on this meeting and for
50:01
bringing together a diverse group of people in attendance under one roof
50:07
out of all the companies that Birkshshire Hathway owns there was one that you acquired the Chicago based
50:15
company Portillos Hot Dogs how did you know that this would be a good fit for the overall company's
50:24
portfolio well I'll have to ask Greg about that because I don't know anything about it so maybe he bought it when I
50:31
was looking the other way but
50:37
I think I got to call a friend on this one uh yeah I I
50:43
u I we own a lot of companies but I do like to think I know most of them but
50:48
but the uh uh and and maybe a subsidiary of a
50:55
subsidiary in some way but but I I really don't know a thing about it i'm sorry but that that may be a good thing
51:02
i do know something about hot dogs though and and we do have a lot of companies in
51:07
Chicago Warren yeah through Marman and that's been a great opportunity where we've accumulated a a variety of uh
51:15
excellent companies under that portfolio but as you noted uh I don't believe Portillos falls under
51:23
that no I I look at I I look at the financial
51:29
statements of about Yeah perhaps 50 or
51:34
60 of our companies uh every every month
51:40
uh but in the case of Marman for example Marman itself owns over a hundred
51:46
companies and uh yeah it uh it was the creature of it was created by Jay
51:54
Pritsker and uh and his brother Bob and
51:59
it was a remarkable company when we bought it but But it was highly diversified already and then we've
52:05
diversified it further so it is it is something of a birker within
52:11
Bergkshire and uh uh we found we found that that's working
52:19
uh very good as arrangement it it was interesting jay
52:24
Pritsker was a uh uh remarkable manager and there's
52:32
various branches of the Pritsker family so you you'll it's
52:38
it's really goes back to A and Pritsker before J and so on but in in
52:44
19 54 they changed the federal tax
52:50
code very dramatically in the United States it was quite a blow to me because
52:56
I've been at Colombia and I'd been reading a JK Lasser book about the tax
53:01
code and then they went and changed the whole damn thing so it but 54 was a big
53:07
year big change those years come every now and then like 1986 and uh and you
53:14
may see a big one one of these days uh and there was a company called Rockwood
53:22
Chocolates in in U Brooklyn and they
53:28
made Rockwood Chocolate Bits which we used to sell at the Buffett grocery store and people made chocolate chip
53:33
cookies out of them and everything and uh then it turned out that cocoa which
53:40
lately has had a big run too cocoa was 5 cents a pound in 1941 when LIFO was
53:49
first allowed for for insurance for for tax
53:54
purposes and the Rockwood chocolate company went into on the LIO message so they they
54:02
owned like 30 million pounds or thereabouts of Coco and then Coco took a
54:10
run in 1955 and I had just moved to New York
54:15
and uh uh there was a provision in the new tax code that if you were in two or
54:24
more companies uh and you did certain things and you've
54:29
been in them for 5 years and you got out of one of them that there would be no capital gains tax unlike all inventory
54:37
gains and tax rates were around 48% maybe 52% and so you there was this huge
54:44
profit this cuz um uh the cocoa had gone up in price but that
54:52
made it terrible for them in selling Rockwood chocolate bits because the
54:57
price of retail of the chocolate bits did not match what was going on at wholesale something almost identical has
55:05
been happening in the chocolate business recently hershey chocolate just came out said they're going to have a bad quarter
55:11
and we're paying $4.50 a pound for chocolate that from co
55:18
because things are going on in West Africa that that make uh cocoa prices go
55:24
up dramatically in any event Jay Pritsker bought
55:30
control of Rockwood the chocolate company and like I say I was 24 or five
55:37
years old and they called the meeting to split off
55:42
the to uh one one of the chocolate businesses in a way that would then enable them to
55:50
to recognize the gain on this these cocoa beans without paying 50% roughly
55:55
50% federal taxes on the gain so I went to the meeting which was in
56:02
Brooklyn and nobody was there this is in the turn every page category except one
56:08
guy and I was 24 and he was 29 and it was Jay Pritsker and nobody had showed
56:16
up at the meeting and it was kind of a crummy building they had but they had a lot of coco there and Jay just gave me a
56:23
lecture or a lesson really I should say on on the tax code and I mean it would I
56:30
I could have gone to graduate school for years and never learned as watch as he did and then
56:36
later we actually bought the company that Rockwood Company after he
56:42
did some other things became the basis for Marman and Marman among other things
56:50
uh developed the car that uh won the first Indianapolis Speedway race and uh
56:59
it invented the rear view mirror which I'm not sure is a
57:04
great great advantage in economics or anything but but uh the guy that would
57:11
they used to have on the Indianapolis 500 they had two people in the Our one guy was to look back and see
57:18
what the other people were doing and the other guy was to drive the car and our
57:23
guy got sick and uh so they invented a rear view mirror so if you want to look
57:29
at the kind of you know what's going on in the laboratories of Berkshire Hathaway and we we got people working on
57:37
things like the rear view mirror a a Warren yep i'm happy uh a friend did
57:43
call um so that's that still works
57:49
um Pet Peter Eastwood who runs uh one of our Berkshire subsidiaries and does a
57:54
great job of running it uh tracked down that Portello's is owned by a private
58:00
equity firm called Berkshire Partners so that was the basis of the question but
58:05
it's not associated with uh with Berkshire so we got we got to the bottom
58:10
of that one yeah thank you [Music]
58:18
Peter that's just a sample of the way we operate around
58:28
okay Becky all right this question comes from Jessica Pune who says "You've long been
58:37
a strong believer in the American tailwind and the resilience of the United States and history has proven you
58:44
correct today the US appears to be undergoing significant and potentially revolutionary changes some investors are
58:52
now questioning the concept of American exceptionalism in your view are investors being overly
58:58
pessimistic about the US economy or is the country indeed entering a period of
59:03
fundamental change that requires a reassessment from a new perspective
59:09
well I would say that Jessica who I believe is in
59:14
some she is the uh stepgranddaughter of one of our managers that I I mentioned
59:20
in the annual report may not be the same one but in any event uh America's been
59:26
America's been insignificant and revolutionary changing really ever since it was developed i
59:34
mentioned that you know we started out as an agricultural society we started out as a society with
59:42
with high promises and we didn't deliver on very well we we said all men were
59:47
created equal and then we wrote a constitution that said blacks get three counted as three fifths and and in
59:56
article two you you'll find male pronouns used 20 times and no female
1:00:01
pronouns used so you know it took till 2000 I
1:00:07
mean you know 2000 or 1920 I should say uh till the
1:00:14
19th until the 19th amendment was passed saying "Oh yeah we promised the women
1:00:22
this back in 1776 and now we'll do something about it." And then we didn't do something about it for a long time so
1:00:28
we're always in the process of change will always find all kinds of things to criticize
1:00:35
uh in the country but the luckiest day in my life is the day I was born you
1:00:41
know because I was born in the United States and at the time
1:00:47
about 3% of all the births in the world were taking place in the United States
1:00:53
and uh I'd like to say that I had something to do you know listen so sent
1:01:00
messages out to My parents for God's sakes moved to the United States before I born or anything but I was just lucky
1:01:06
and I was lucky to be born i was lucky to be born white i was l all kinds of things but it's been if you don't think
1:01:13
the United States has changed since I was born in 1930 it's been we've gone through all kinds of things and gone
1:01:20
through great recessions we've gone through world wars we've gone through the development of a atomic bomb that
1:01:27
that uh we never dreamt of you know at the time I was born so I I would not get
1:01:33
discouraged about the fact that that never doesn't look like if we've solved every problem that's come along and uh
1:01:41
uh if I were being born today you know I I would just keep negotiating in the
1:01:48
womb until they they said you can be in the United States so it uh uh we're all
1:01:55
pretty
1:02:02
lucky do you want to give any We've got two non United States guys here just to get the other side
1:02:09
who now live in the US
1:02:15
okay station four
1:02:23
hi Mr buffett my name is Daniel and I'm from Tennifly New Jersey first of all I just want to say how grateful I am for
1:02:30
getting the opportunity to ask you a question when it comes to your principles of investing you often talk
1:02:36
about how important it is to be patient has there ever been a situation in your investing career where breaking that
1:02:42
principle and acting fast has benefited you thank you well that's a good question and
1:02:51
uh there are times when you have to act fast in fact uh we made a great deal of money because
1:02:58
we're willing to act faster than anybody around
1:03:04
uh Jessica Tombs is I I think she's the
1:03:10
stepdaughter of of um our stepg granddaughter of Ben Rosner a manager of
1:03:17
ours and in 1966 I got a call from a fellow named
1:03:24
Fel Steiner in New York and he said "I I represent
1:03:30
uh Mrs annenburgg uh and there were there were
1:03:36
actually nine Anenburgg sisters I believe before War Anenberg came along as the son but he said "We have a
1:03:43
business we'd like to sell you." So I called Charlie up and uh I got a few
1:03:49
details and it sounded very interesting and uh
1:03:55
uh Charlie and I went back to the office of Will Felsteiner in New York
1:04:02
was a marvelous guy never met him since but uh he was handling things
1:04:08
for Mrs uh well ace a a Simon Butchune and her
1:04:14
name was Annberg and her husband had been the partner of of Ben Roer but he had died
1:04:23
and uh and Ben got kind of tense about working
1:04:29
with her uh and so he u offered us this
1:04:36
business at a bargain price he offered us a business for $6 million it had $2 million of cash it had a $2 million
1:04:43
piece of property in a 900 block of of u what's the key street in Philadelphia
1:04:50
down there market Street and uh and it was making 2 million a year pre-tax and
1:04:56
the price was 6 million and Charlie and I went back to this place and
1:05:02
uh Ben Rosner was there and he really he
1:05:09
just was upset about doing business with his his partner's widow he was she was
1:05:15
extremely wealthy and uh and he just didn't he wasn't enjoying it he was very
1:05:22
nervous about selling it and he he said to me and Charlie he said uh
1:05:29
um he said "I'll run this business for you until December 31st and then I'm out
1:05:35
of here." And I got Charlie and we went out in the hallway and I said "If this guy
1:05:40
quits at the end of the year you can throw away every book on psychology I've ever read." happy and so that began a wonderful we
1:05:49
bought the company had a great relationship and did I know that morning
1:05:55
when I got a phone call uh from Will Fsteiner there was background about it
1:06:02
uh uh I' I've had a couple of
1:06:08
times and that was one of them where people in the
1:06:15
east felt that they had a a stereotype in their mind of what
1:06:21
people from the Midwest were like and uh Ben had been married his first
1:06:28
marriage was to a woman from Iowa and he just figured that anybody from the
1:06:33
Midwest was okay and uh the trick when you do when you get in business with
1:06:39
somebody or get in a room with somebody like that and they want to sell you something for $6 million that's got 2
1:06:44
million of cash and couple million of real estate and it's making 2 million a year
1:06:50
uh you don't you don't want to be patient then you want to be patient and waiting to
1:06:56
get the occasional call my phone will ring sometime you know and with
1:07:02
something that you know wakes me up i may be sleeping in there or something
1:07:08
but it it you just never know when it'll happen and that's what makes it what
1:07:13
makes it fun i mean it it uh uh
1:07:19
so patience it it's a combination of of of
1:07:26
patience and a willingness to do something that afternoon if it comes to you you don't want to be you don't want
1:07:33
to be patient about about acting on deals that make sense and you don't want
1:07:38
to be very patient with people are talking to you about things that will never happen so
1:07:44
uh it's it's not a it's not a constant asset it's not a constant liability to
1:07:50
be patient greg you Well Warren I was going to add uh as you're being patient
1:07:56
I I happen to know and I think that goes for our uh Ajit also and all our managers uh very patient when we're
1:08:04
looking at opportunities and as you touched on we want to act quickly but while we're being patient um never
1:08:10
underestimate the amount of reading and work that's being done to be prepared uh
1:08:16
to act quickly because we we do know be it equities but I would include a
1:08:22
variety of of private companies that when the opportunity presents itself
1:08:27
we're ready to act and and that's a large part of uh being patient is is
1:08:33
using it to be prepared yeah and and of course it it
1:08:39
doesn't come in anything like an even flow i mean it's the most uneven sort of activity you could get
1:08:46
into and uh uh the main thing you have to do is you
1:08:52
have to be willing to hang up after 5 seconds and you have to be willing to say yes after 5 seconds
1:08:59
and and uh uh you can't you can't be filled with
1:09:07
self-doubt in the business you just forget it isn't going to work that uh uh
1:09:13
go into some other activity uh uh
1:09:19
but you also I mean one of the great pleasures
1:09:25
it is the great pleasure actually in this business is having people trust you
1:09:30
and that's that's really the why why work at 90 when you've got more money than anybody could count you know if
1:09:37
they started today and had machines there helping them and everything else
1:09:42
it that it means nothing in terms of of uh how you're going to live or how your
1:09:49
children are going to live or anything else uh and uh but it it it and but both
1:09:56
Charlie and I we just enjoyed the fact that people trusted us and they trusted
1:10:02
us 60 years ago or 70 years ago and and and partnerships we had and uh we never
1:10:11
sought out professional investors to join our
1:10:17
partnerships among all my partners I never had a single institution i never I never wanted an
1:10:23
institution i wanted people and I I didn't want people that were sitting around and having people present to them
1:10:30
every 3 months and and tell them what they wanted to hear and all that sort of
1:10:35
thing so and and that's what we got and that's why we've got this group here today so it it's all worked out but that
1:10:45
uh it it's you don't want to be patient when
1:10:52
things are going your when when the time comes to act it uh you you want to get
1:10:58
it done that day okay Becky
1:11:03
this question is from Flavio Montenegro a shareholder from Guatemala um a couple of years ago in
1:11:10
this meeting Mr jane outlined the significant challenges GEICO faced in modernizing and integrating its IT
1:11:17
systems it was also mentioned that competitors were ahead in their pricing strategies because of the use of
1:11:23
telematics today GEICO's turnaround is evident through strong pricing and operational improvements could you
1:11:30
provide more details on the specific actions taken under Todd's leadership and how those changes will help sustain
1:11:36
a long-term competitive advantage in the coming years yeah uh Todd has done a
1:11:42
great job for us in terms of turn turning around the operations when he took over uh there
1:11:50
were two major issues that Geico was behind its
1:11:55
competitors on firstly the term we used and we all have been using is matching
1:12:02
rate to risk and secondly telematics we were at the bottom of the list in so
1:12:09
far as telematics are concerned about 5 6 years ago uh since then we have made
1:12:16
rapid strides and telematics which used to be a source of competitive disadvantage to us is no longer so and I
1:12:25
would argue that our telematics at Geico is about as good as anyone else's today so that's been one huge catch up
1:12:32
secondly in terms of matching rate to risk there again I think we have caught up with our competitors and we as good
1:12:39
as anyone else in in the field all this together with the cost reduction effort
1:12:44
that Geico and Todd gets a lot of credit for he has basically reduced the
1:12:50
workforce by 20,000 starting with something close to 50 odd,000 he's brought it down to 20,000 and that
1:12:57
translates to uh I guess at least $2 billion per year so all this has allowed
1:13:04
Geico to become a much focused competitor so much so in the last seven
1:13:11
quarters Geico has shown a combined ratio that has a eight in front of it and I never thought I'd live to see the
1:13:17
day when anyone could have a combined ratio at so low as it is right now so I
1:13:23
think Geico has done a great job uh it's 80 combined translates to the the
1:13:30
largest profit anyone is making on the underwriting side in the personal automobile business so you know we've
1:13:37
achieved a lot todd has achieved a lot but I do not want to be so arrogant as
1:13:42
to say that mission accomplished uh we've achieved a lot but I still think
1:13:48
we need to do a lot more in technology ai as we talked about is going to be a
1:13:54
big force and we need to play catchup there not catchup but we are to be in a state of readiness so I think Geico is
1:14:02
in a great shape right now uh did Warren you want to add anything no I it's it's
1:14:09
it's a fascinating case study but and that's what's so interesting about the
1:14:16
whole game of business but particularly about our businesses is that that each
1:14:21
one is a little different uh but they're all they all have challenges of certain
1:14:28
sorts and but they also many certain numbers have opportunities we we
1:14:35
paid $50 million for half of GEICO in
1:14:40
1976 what turned out to be half a geico 50 million 50 50
1:14:48
uh we now own 100% but 50% of two billion that we earned in the first
1:14:54
quarter is a billion dollars which on a $50 million investment is you know 20
1:15:03
for one in a quarter uh so it you know now that takes years to
1:15:10
develop but the interesting thing is the auto insurance policy which didn't even
1:15:18
exist 100 years ago i mean you you didn't you just well I should say 120
1:15:25
years ago uh but there it's by far the largest item in the property casualty
1:15:31
insurance business it's it's huge the the only thing I'd like to add is in addition to the underwriting profit
1:15:37
GEICO provides $29 billion a float oh yeah in addition yeah and that's not
1:15:43
unimportant when you paid $50 million to get the businesses it's giving you $29 billion to work with for nothing and on
1:15:51
top of that gives you a billion dollars of of profit in a quarter
1:15:56
uh the interesting thing about auto insurance is that that we are the
1:16:02
company was started in 1936 we're selling the same product as 1936 we're
1:16:09
we're being more sophisticated about pricing it than we were then somebody just made the judgment a fellow that
1:16:15
came from USAA uh made the judgment that that
1:16:21
government employees the name Geico stands for government employees insurance company that government
1:16:27
employees were better drivers than average and uh I don't think he was an actuary or
1:16:34
anything else but he just made an observation and uh so he left USAA which
1:16:40
is still a very successful company and he started Geico for a few
1:16:46
hundred,000 and he made money the first year from my underwriting he made money the second year this is not a public
1:16:52
offering type thing to you know use phony accounting for 10 years and all that sort of thing just prices to make
1:17:00
money and uh that's exactly what's been done since 1936 the policy really you
1:17:08
know your insurance your auto insurance policy that looks a lot like the one that you had then and this huge field
1:17:14
has sprung up uh around us and it's still growing and and of course nobody
1:17:20
likes to to buy insurance but they sure like to drive and and and uh uh Geico is a
1:17:31
fascinating story and about three times over the years the company is
1:17:37
gotten sidetracked one way or another and uh and then it gets back to its
1:17:42
basics and and it's a wonderful wonderful business and and uh we showed
1:17:50
at this annual meeting one time a a uh message from Laura
1:17:57
Murdavidson and Lauren Murdavidson in in January of
1:18:03
1950 was the only person in the ing that uh I'd gone down on a Saturday
1:18:10
to visit but turned out they didn't work on Saturdays in Washington and I pounded on the door till finally a janitor let
1:18:16
me in and I said to the janitor is there anybody I can talk to here except you
1:18:23
and he didn't take it personally and he said well there's one guy up on the sixth floor and a fellow named Larmer
1:18:29
Davidson did wonderful things for me you you get a
1:18:35
breaks in life in terms of people you will meet who can just change your life
1:18:44
dramatically and uh if you if you you need a handful of those and uh and when
1:18:51
you get them you treasure them and we've had them on on this board at Bergkshire
1:18:57
you know if you take Tom Murphy and Sandy Goddisdman and Walter Scott and
1:19:02
Bill Scott we we one thing we've done is we've held on
1:19:09
to the human assets we've made lifelong assets out of people that that are the
1:19:14
right sort and uh with incredible talent but also just lots of fun to work with
1:19:20
and always doing more than their share and you know it to get a chance to talk
1:19:27
to Lauren Davidson on a Saturday afternoon you just listen carefully uh
1:19:34
and that comes in the in the category of turn every page
1:19:41
you know some of them you want to turn pretty fast but but uh
1:19:46
uh you just get lucky in life and you want to take advantage of your luck
1:19:52
okay station five
1:19:57
my name is Benjamin Graham Sanderson from Pasadena California warren thank you for all you've taught us over the
1:20:04
years earlier you said nobody but Steve Jobs could have created Apple but nobody
1:20:09
but Tim Cook could have developed it like he has warren nobody but you could have
1:20:15
created Bergkshire and I presume you view Greg as an outlier among
1:20:20
outliers but he seems so normal
1:20:26
sorry Greg yeah that's a nice way of saying not normal actually but I appreciate it
1:20:33
so I was hoping you could share what specifically about Greg makes him your preferred successor and Greg we're
1:20:40
excited to get to know you more over the next few decades thank you thank you
1:20:46
thank you well you you've hit on the most
1:20:53
important question and know in terms of the business we've got a wonderful group of
1:20:59
businesses we've got a uh we've got an ability to do things that nobody else
1:21:04
can do which is hard to get in the capitalistic system it's been developed as fully as as as the United States has
1:21:13
been i mean imagine being able to create something that is in a very very
1:21:20
very big playing field i don't think you'd really be very very hard to
1:21:26
develop anything like it i don't think you could develop the people around it that let alone the capital position you
1:21:33
know and the history and everything else and the answer of course is that it it
1:21:39
does take a a long long time and it takes getting around you
1:21:46
a small cadre of people which then spreads out somewhat but
1:21:54
uh where you've got mutual trust uh where people do more than their
1:22:01
share and I've been around a lot of businesses over the
1:22:07
years and by nature I'm somewhat critical of everything i mean I I I'm
1:22:14
looking for what's wrong in things because that's part of investing is is looking you know what aren't you what
1:22:21
are you missing uh but we have
1:22:27
uh you know we've got people that if they're asked to put on a show like this
1:22:34
instead of doing whatever their regular job is they they participated
1:22:39
i went around the groups of people who were exhibiting yesterday for an hour
1:22:45
and a half and these are people who are thanking me you know and totally
1:22:51
enthused about coming and doing a lot of work for which they don't get paid anything extra i don't know anything
1:22:57
about the arrangements the individual companies make but they they work hard
1:23:03
and they enjoy their work and uh you know you really want to work at
1:23:09
something you enjoy i've always had I've had five bosses in life and I liked
1:23:15
every one of them and they were all interesting i still decided that I'd rather work for myself than anybody else
1:23:22
but but if you if you find people that are wonderful to work with you know
1:23:28
that's the place to go and I've I've told my kids that basically you don't get lucky like I did
1:23:36
when I found it seven or eight years of age what really interested me you know
1:23:41
it could have taken a lot longer but but uh uh you want to uh find the song find
1:23:51
the sound is uh there's a movie called The Glenn Miller Story and Glenn Miller went on from having a broken down band
1:23:58
for 15 years to to uh turning out the first he found the sound and and uh and
1:24:08
created the first gold record i don't know whether any of you know what it was but it was the Chattanooga Chuju and in
1:24:15
1941 I think it was uh and he turned around from being a a nothing in with a band that he had till
1:24:24
he found the sound and uh I always have told my kids ever since that their their
1:24:31
their sound isn't my sound you know but uh and you don't find it necessarily on
1:24:39
the first job you take cuz you got to eat you know and but if you get lucky
1:24:46
like I did you you find it be you find it when you're very young and then you
1:24:52
know just keep doing it and uh And don't worry don't worry too much
1:24:59
about starting salaries and don't worry about about
1:25:05
uh and be very careful who you work for because you will take on the habits of
1:25:11
the people around you so there's certain certain jobs you shouldn't take and uh
1:25:19
but you've got the greatest country in the world and you got the greatest time in the world so uh I would say
1:25:26
that that uh well I while I'm handing this over to Greg
1:25:34
that uh that you know you can't even dream all the dreams
1:25:40
that you could have about a place like Berkshire but big thing you have to do though is always is to be sure you can
1:25:47
play the next day i mean in terms of in terms of
1:25:54
financial activities on a meaningful scale uh you know
1:26:02
you you don't want to go you don't there was
1:26:08
a a book about what was the name of that book uh you only have to get rich once I
1:26:14
mean you don't you don't want to do anything that risks
1:26:20
uh what's been created so you don't you if if very stupid things are happening
1:26:25
around you you do know not want to participate if people are making more
1:26:31
money because they're borrowing money or they're participating in in
1:26:37
securities that are really pieces of junk but but uh but they they hope to
1:26:44
find a bigger sucker later on you just have to forget that it uh that'll bite
1:26:50
you at some point and and the basic game is so good and you've been so lucky to
1:26:57
be born now i mean if if I've been born in 1700 I'd say I want to go back in the
1:27:05
womb what the hell with this it's too hard and but now I've come along to do
1:27:12
something where I can just play around all day with things I enjoy doing and uh and
1:27:18
uh it's really uh it's a pretty wonderful
1:27:24
life anything Greg you want to add or subtract from that
1:27:30
nothing to subtract but um I I would always just say I couldn't be more as I've said in the past more humbled and
1:27:36
honored obviously to be in this role but to to have actually been part of Bergkshire for Warren it's now 25 plus
1:27:42
years had the opportunity to be part of Berkshire and to to work with you and Ajit and our our board but many other
1:27:49
people in our company and as you touched on um when you find something like that
1:27:55
and you find something like that like Bergkshire that's so special It's it you
1:28:00
fall in love with it and it's it becomes just what you want to do every day and it's just an incredible opportunity so
1:28:06
thank you [Applause]
1:28:15
and to the gentleman who asked the question if if you don't find it immediately you know uh don't starve to
1:28:22
death or anything in the meantime but but but uh you will find it and and
1:28:28
you'll you'll find it in in the right individual in in a sense it's somewhat
1:28:34
like finding the right person in marriage i mean that uh probably the first some of you
1:28:40
married may have married the person you made met on your first date although I
1:28:46
guess they don't even have dates anymore but but the uh uh but you know it's it uh sometimes it
1:28:54
pays to wait too okay Becky
1:28:59
uh this is a question from Mark Bonnke and Helen Friedrien in Rapid City South
1:29:04
Dakota as the US dollar quickly loses value in relation to other foreign
1:29:10
currencies in 2025 is Berkshire Hathaway taking steps to minimize this currency
1:29:16
risk and its impact on quarterly and annual earnings if so please explain and
1:29:21
I I'll just add from Mary Chang another shareholder berkshire currently borrows
1:29:26
in Japanese yen to offset its currency risk and its Japanese stock investments in the future will you invest in foreign
1:29:33
currency denominated assets unhedged yeah well we always have um pretty much
1:29:40
uh the Japanese situation is different because we we do intend to stay so long
1:29:46
with that position and the funding situation is so cheap that u we
1:29:54
essentially have have attempted to some degree to to match purchases against the
1:30:02
end denominated of funding uh but that's not a policy of ours in
1:30:08
fact that's the first time we we've we've done that and and we've owned lots
1:30:13
of securities of uh of of in in foreign currency so
1:30:20
uh we do nothing in in u in terms of the question about its
1:30:27
impact on quarterly and annual earnings uh we don't do anything based on its
1:30:33
impact on quarterly and annual earnings i mean there's never been a board
1:30:39
meeting I can remember where I or a conversation I had with Charlie when I said where I say if we do this our
1:30:46
annual earnings will be this you know and therefore we ought to whether it's accounting or whe anything uh we just
1:30:55
you know the the number will turn out to be what it'll be what counts as where we
1:31:00
are five or 10 or 20 years from now and and if you start focusing on what number
1:31:07
you're going to produce uh you will quickly get tempted at least based on
1:31:13
the experience I've seen from viewing 20 companies you will get so you'll one way
1:31:19
or another uh play around with the numbers and sometimes seriously play around with the numbers and uh uh I've
1:31:27
seen people that that you know I trust him in all kinds of other ways but they regard playing
1:31:34
around with numbers is perfectly okay and that's just not something you know
1:31:42
we just don't think about that so uh actually the the uh the end um
1:31:50
um uh the relationship of the end behavior
1:31:55
of the end in the last quarter you know resulted in
1:32:02
certain gap charges and uh but it doesn't make it it doesn't make any
1:32:07
difference it'll change next you know next month or next year and and obviously we wouldn't want to
1:32:14
be owning anything that we thought was in a currency that was really going to
1:32:19
hell and that's the big thing we worry about with the United States currency i mean it the the
1:32:27
tendency of a government to want to debase its currency over time
1:32:35
is there's no system that beats that you you can pick dictators you can pick representatives you can do anything
1:32:42
but but the people there there will be a a push
1:32:49
toward weaker currencies and of course that is I mentioned very briefly in the
1:32:54
annual report that that the fiscal policy is what scares me in the United
1:32:59
States because it's it's made the way it is and
1:33:05
uh and uh all the motivations are to doing a lot of things
1:33:12
that will cause can cause trouble with with money but that's not limited to the
1:33:19
United States it's all over the world and some places it gets out of control
1:33:25
regularly as you know they know they know no they
1:33:31
uh they devalue at rates that are breathtaking and that's continued i mean
1:33:38
and you people can study economics and you can have all kinds of arrangements but in the end if you've got people that
1:33:45
control the currency uh you can you can issue
1:33:53
uh paper money and you will or you can engage in clipping currencies like
1:33:59
they used to do centuries ago or there will always be people
1:34:08
And it's the nature of their job i don't I don't I'm not singling them out as particularly evil or anything like that
1:34:15
but the natural course of government is to is to make the currency worth less
1:34:23
uh over time and uh and that's got important consequences and it's very hard to build checks and balances into
1:34:31
the system to keep that from happening and uh we've had a lot of fun here in the
1:34:40
last either the first 100 days or the last 100 days whatever you want to call it the uh uh
1:34:49
watching what happens when people try to
1:34:54
make sure that they aren't running fiscal risks and uh that game isn't over
1:35:00
and it never will be over it you know in finality if you
1:35:07
look if you look up in in search the great
1:35:13
inflations of post World War II it's just a list that goes on forever and the same names
1:35:20
keep popping up and everything so currency is a the value of currency is a
1:35:26
scary thing and and uh
1:35:31
uh we don't have any great system for beating that we do in this
1:35:38
particular Japanese position because we expect to hold it for 50 or 100 years or
1:35:43
more and we will be owning something that's denominated in the end and easily
1:35:49
predictable and we'll just as long as the carry honored is right and everything will will uh will attempt to
1:35:58
issue uh Japanese denominated liabilities but
1:36:03
that that's not because of anything we care about in terms of quarterly or
1:36:08
annual earnings greg do you have anything to say on that i was just going to say that relative to the question
1:36:15
that there's no question we were fundamentally very comfortable with investing in the five Japanese companies
1:36:22
and recognizing we're investing in yen the fact we could then borrow in yen was
1:36:28
a almost just like a nice incremental opportunity but we were very comfortable
1:36:33
both with the Japanese companies and with the currency we would ultimately
1:36:38
realize i.e in the yen yeah we we only made as I referred to
1:36:43
earlier one big currency play which was connected a little bit with when I wrote that article for
1:36:51
fortune and we got long 12 other currencies as I remember
1:36:57
only four or five of them are really big currencies but when when I say we got
1:37:02
long it that means we're short the dollar and uh so we held that position for a couple years and we we made
1:37:08
several billion dollars on it which was significant to us then still is uh the
1:37:17
uh Charlie always felt that if if he had to pick an area
1:37:24
outside of stocks in which to invest and he knew a lot about bonds he
1:37:31
knew a lot about real estate he knew a lot about a lot of things but he he said the he thought he could he he thought he
1:37:38
could make a lot of money out of being in foreign currency but uh uh we just
1:37:46
we've done it once it's not inconceivable we would do it again but
1:37:51
it's unlikely uh but there could be things
1:37:58
happen in the United States that would make us want to own a lot of other
1:38:03
currencies and I I suppose if we if we made
1:38:09
some very large investment European country or some there might be a
1:38:15
situation where we would do a lot of financing in in their currency but it's
1:38:21
it's not a it it was something that just was sort
1:38:27
of obvious to do in the Japanese situation where we had the ability to
1:38:33
borrow a very very low carrying uh carrying cost and uh and we
1:38:41
felt very good about the income we'd be receiving from these securities and we
1:38:48
and if the present condition which it won't I mean it never does but pre
1:38:55
prevail for decades and decades we would probably keep doing the same sort of
1:39:01
thing but uh things change in the world too so
1:39:06
don't take that as a prediction
1:39:13
okay section
1:39:20
six uh good morning Warren and Greg Ajit thank you so much for hosting this event
1:39:27
good to be here my name is Dash Boyinder and I'm from great country of Mongolia a
1:39:37
little bit background about my country mongol is an emerging market and
1:39:42
landlocked country sandwiched between Russia and China but we are rich in
1:39:49
history and minerals and have full democracy and growing economy last week
1:39:56
we hosted our second annual Mongolia investor conference in New York to
1:40:02
attract investors like yourself i know you meet and give advice
1:40:09
informally to government leaders such as South Korea China and India what advice
1:40:16
would you give to government business leaders of emerging markets like
1:40:22
Mongolia to attract institutional investors like yourself it'd be great if
1:40:29
you have long-term plans for exposure to emerging markets as a hedge or an
1:40:35
opportunistic investment lastly I welcome all of you to Mongolia
1:40:42
and my country folks would be very happy if you can make it to our economic forum
1:40:50
this July oh thank
1:40:57
you yeah I I have trouble planning a trip to Council Bluffs which is just a few miles
1:41:03
from here but takes an optimist uh actually I met
1:41:08
a fellow here at the annual meeting um oh probably 20 years ago or more who did
1:41:15
a lot in Mongolia and uh uh it he's he did very well in Mongolia
1:41:24
and uh actually moved there for quite a while uh I would say
1:41:31
that if if you're looking for advice to give the government over there it's to
1:41:37
develop a reputation for for having a solid currency over time i mean
1:41:44
that we we we don't really want to go into any
1:41:51
country where we think that there's a a chance I mean a significant probability
1:41:58
of runaway inflation it just it's too hard to figure people other people have
1:42:04
figured out ways to make money in in hyperinflationary situations but
1:42:11
uh that's not our game and I I I don't think I'd play it well so
1:42:18
uh we wouldn't be we that that would be that would be a
1:42:24
factor with us the chances are and we won't find anything in Mongolia that fits our size requirements aside from
1:42:30
that but I but like I say I it uh I think my friend that I met here 20 years
1:42:36
ago has done very well in in uh Mongolia and if if the country develops a
1:42:44
reputation for being businessfriendly and currency
1:42:50
conscious conscious uh and I think that that bolds very well
1:42:57
for the the res the residents of that country particularly if it has some other natural assets that uh it can
1:43:05
build around uh I don't know that much about the minerals there or anything of the sort but but uh uh I mean who would
1:43:14
have been on the United States in 1790 but uh
1:43:20
um we we we didn't we didn't have to have
1:43:25
perfection we just had to be better than the other guy for quite a while and we started out with nothing and we
1:43:32
ended up with close to 25% of the world's GDP and faster growth rates
1:43:39
and generally sounder currencies and all kinds of things but uh so uh I wish you
1:43:48
well okay Becky this question is from Peter Shen
1:43:55
in New Jersey uh it's for Mr buffett and Mr jane in recent years large private
1:44:01
equity firms like Blackstone Apollo and KKR have aggressively expanded into
1:44:06
insurance raising permanent capital managing float and aiming to replicate the model that Bergkshire pioneered
1:44:13
decades ago given that these firms are now directly competing for insurance assets often using higher leverage and
1:44:20
more aggressive investment strategies how do you view their impact on Berkshire's insurance operations and
1:44:26
underwriting discipline do you believe that the qu private equity model poses risks to policy holders in the broad
1:44:33
financial system and has this competition made it more challenging for Berkshire to find and price insurance
1:44:39
opportunities safely and profitably today
1:44:44
okay yeah part of the question is very easy there's no question the private
1:44:49
equity firms have come into the space and we are no longer competitive in this
1:44:55
space we used to do a fair amount in this space uh but in the last 3 four years I don't think we've done a single
1:45:01
deal now you ought to separate this whole segment in two separate segments
1:45:07
one is the property casualty end of the business and the life end of the business uh the private equity firms
1:45:13
that you mentioned are all very active in the life end of the business not the property casualty end of the business
1:45:20
uh you are right in identifying the risks in these private equity firms are
1:45:26
taking on both in terms of leverage and in terms of credit risk and while the
1:45:32
economy is doing great and credit spreads are low these pe the private equity firms who've taken the assets
1:45:40
from very conservative investments and I wouldn't
1:45:45
say high octane but they've certainly invested these assets in
1:45:50
situations where that where they get a lot more uh return on the investment and
1:45:55
as I said as long as the economy is good and credit spreads are low they will
1:46:01
make money they'll make a lot of money because of leverage uh however there is
1:46:06
always the danger that at some point the regulators might get cranky and say you know you're taking too too much risk on
1:46:13
behalf of your policy holders uh and that could end in tears is we do not
1:46:21
like the riskreward that these situations offer and therefore we put up the white flag and said you know we
1:46:27
can't compete in this segment right now yeah I
1:46:35
think there are people that want to copy Burku's
1:46:42
model but usually they don't want to copy it by also copying the model of
1:46:49
the CEO having all of his money in the company forever and uh I mean they've
1:46:55
got a different equation they're they're interested in and and you know and
1:47:01
that's capitalism but they have a whole different uh situation and and they
1:47:06
probably have a somewhat different fiduciary feeling uh about what they're doing and uh and
1:47:14
sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't work and if it doesn't work they go on to other things and if I what we
1:47:21
do here at Bergkshire doesn't work I spend the end of my life regretting what I've created so it it uh it's just a
1:47:27
whole different personal equation and uh there is no property casualty
1:47:35
company that can basically replicate Birkshire
1:47:40
that that wasn't the case at the start i mean at the start we just had national indemnity a few miles from here and
1:47:47
anybody could have duplicated what we had but uh but that was before a
1:47:55
G and and the G came with us in 1986 and and
1:48:01
at that point the other fellow should have given up
1:48:06
[Applause]
1:48:12
station seven please hi my name is Marie i'm from Melrose
1:48:20
Massachusetts thank you for the time today as a young person interested in
1:48:25
investing like myself I would love to hear your insights Mr buffett what were
1:48:31
some pivotal lessons you learned early in your career and what advice do you
1:48:36
have young for young investors who are looking to develop their investment
1:48:41
philosophy thank you well those are good questions i wish I thought of them myself earlier in my
1:48:49
life uh the you know who you associate with is
1:48:55
just enormously important and don't expect that you'll make every decision right on
1:49:01
that i mean but you you are going to go into you're going to have your life
1:49:08
progress in the general direction of the people that you that you work with that
1:49:14
you admire that become your friends uh I
1:49:19
mentioned a few fellows that that have died in the last couple years
1:49:25
well all of those people were people that that that
1:49:30
uh you know if we were working together on something 1 10,000th the size of
1:49:36
Burkshire I mean they'd be the kind of people you choose you just they're there
1:49:41
people that make you want to be better than you are and you want to hang out
1:49:46
with people that are better than you are and that you feel are better than you are because you're going to go in the
1:49:51
direction of the people that you you associate with and uh and that's that's
1:49:59
something you learn and of course you learn it late in life that uh
1:50:05
you you uh it's hard to really appreciate how
1:50:11
important some of those factors are until you get much older but when you've
1:50:16
got people around you like Tom Murphy and and like like
1:50:23
well like just name them Sandy Goddisman that uh Walter Scott that uh you're just
1:50:30
going to live a better life than than uh you do if you just go out and look at
1:50:38
somebody that's making a lot of money and decide you're going to try and copy him or something of the sort uh uh so I
1:50:44
would I would I would try to I tried to be associated with smart
1:50:50
people too where I could learn a lot from them and I would try to look for something that I would do if I didn't
1:50:56
need the money i mean what you're really looking for life is something where you've got a job that you'd hold if you
1:51:02
didn't need the money and I've had that charlie had it for a very very long time in fact all the fellows I named uh
1:51:11
had it and uh and they also every one of those ones I named
1:51:18
they always did more than their share and they sought they never sought more than their share of the credit they just
1:51:24
behaved as the way you you'd like anybody you you work with and when you
1:51:30
find them you treasure them and and when you don't find them you still keep doing whatever
1:51:36
causes you to eat uh or enables you to eat but uh but you don't you don't give
1:51:42
up on on looking around and you will find you'll find people do wonderful
1:51:48
things for you i mentioned I mentioned uh uh earlier the
1:51:53
you know going down to Geico and knocking on the door when the door was locked i mean who knows what was behind
1:52:00
that door i went in but but you know in 10 minutes I found that I had a man that
1:52:08
uh was going to be just wonderfully helpful to me and of course if somebody's going to be helpful to you
1:52:15
you want to try to figure out ways to be helpful to them so you get a compounding of of good intentions and good
1:52:22
behavior and unfortunately you can get the reverse of that in life too and uh
1:52:29
and you know with a lot of I I was lucky in having a a good
1:52:36
environment for uh living that kind of a life and and other people you know have
1:52:43
a whole different environmental situation they have to overcome it but don't be don't feel guilty about your
1:52:50
good luck if you've got if if you know if you've got uh well if you live in the
1:52:56
United States you you know you you've you've uh there 8 billion people in the world
1:53:03
and there's 330 million United States you've already won the game uh to a
1:53:10
great degree and then just keep making the most of it
1:53:15
but you you don't want to you don't want
1:53:20
to associate with people or enterprises that ask you to do something
1:53:27
that or tell you to do something that you shouldn't be doing and
1:53:35
uh that's one of the problems i mean the different professions select for different types
1:53:42
of people and uh uh
1:53:49
there's it's interesting to me that in the investment business
1:53:54
uh uh so many people get out of it after they've made a pile of money that that
1:54:00
uh uh it it you really want something that
1:54:05
you'll stick around for you know whether you need the money greg doesn't need the money or G doesn't need the money uh
1:54:12
remotely and they but they enjoy what they do and they're so damn good at it it's it it's
1:54:21
uh you know it just well I've had the advantage of seeing how that works over
1:54:27
time the best manager I ever knew and there's a lot of contention for who that would
1:54:34
be but actually was Tom Murphy senior that uh who lived the the almost 98 and
1:54:42
uh I've never seen anybody that could get the potential out
1:54:48
of other people uh more than than uh Murf i mean if if if if you
1:54:59
wanted to if you wanted to become a better person you went to work for for
1:55:04
Tom Murphy and uh uh there are all kinds of successful people
1:55:11
that really don't have that sort of don't bring that to the party and and
1:55:18
I'm not saying that's the only way to succeed but I think it's I think it's the most pleasant way to succeed for
1:55:23
sure and uh uh and I think
1:55:29
that you know the the Bergkshire experience is pretty dramatic i mean to to operate
1:55:37
with Sandy Goddisman from
1:55:42
1963 until he died a couple years ago and um Walter
1:55:48
Scott 30 years and Craig operated with him for 25 years
1:55:54
or so whatever it was yeah 30 yeah and and uh you know you really can't miss it uh
1:56:04
and you know you you'll learn all the time but you'll you not only learn how to be successful at business you'll
1:56:11
learn how to be successful at life and uh uh
1:56:17
so that's that's that's my recommendation
1:56:23
and that u and uh and for some reason I apparently you
1:56:31
live longer too because it's pretty amazing i mean these people I'm talking about
1:56:37
including myself I mean I mean you know you can I like to attribute it to this and a few other things
1:56:49
but I I I think a happy person lives longer than somebody that that that's uh
1:56:55
doing some things that they don't really admire that much in life okay
1:57:02
uh let's move on to I guess it's Becky next
1:57:07
um the first quarter ended March 31st and it did show that Bergkshire's cash pile expanded from the end of the last
1:57:15
year but the greatest market turmoil came in April martin Devine a
1:57:20
shareholder from Scotland who is attending the meeting today wants to know has the recent market volatility
1:57:26
presented Bergkshire with opportunities and Martin just wrote in an addendum in the last 40 minutes or so pointing out
1:57:33
that you mentioned Bergkshire almost invested $10 billion recently and wanting to know if you could talk more
1:57:39
about that well the I can give you a good answer to the second part of which is no
1:57:45
but it the but 10 billion wouldn't have done
1:57:51
that much you know that's the other side another side of it
1:57:58
uh what has happened in the last
1:58:03
uh 30 30 45 days 100 days whatever whatever you want to pick up whatever
1:58:09
this uh this uh period has been is is is
1:58:15
really nothing there's been three times since we acquired Bergkshire that
1:58:21
Bergkshire has gone down 50% uh in a fairly short period of time
1:58:27
three different times nothing was fundamentally wrong with the company at any time but but this is not a huge move
1:58:37
uh the Dow Jones average at 381 in September of 1929 they got
1:58:45
down to 42 so that's probably going from 100
1:58:50
uh to 11 uh this is not this has not been a
1:58:57
dramatic uh bare market or anything of the sort i mean it uh it
1:59:04
it you know like uh some pointed out if I've I've had
1:59:13
200 and 50 trading days a day you know for however many years I've been old
1:59:19
enough to trade stocks that got 17 or 18,000 days there's been plenty of
1:59:25
periods that that uh uh just are dramatically different than this i mean
1:59:32
when the day I was born the Dow Jones was a 240 and my first that was August 30th
1:59:39
1930 and between that and the low it went from 240 to 41 i
1:59:46
mean so if people think that
1:59:51
it made a really major change it it didn't if if it gone up 15% instead of
1:59:58
down 15% people think they take that with remarkable grace but uh but uh if
2:00:06
it makes a difference to you whether your stocks are down 15% or not you you're you're you need to get a somewhat
2:00:12
different investment philosophy because the world is not going to adapt to you you're going to have to adapt to the
2:00:19
world and you will see a period in the next certainly in the next 20 years
2:00:26
you'll see a period that that will be in what somebody in the
2:00:32
market described one time as a hair curler compared to anything you've seen
2:00:38
before i mean that's just it just happens periodically the world makes big big big mistakes and
2:00:44
surprises happen in dramatic ways and the more sophisticated the system gets
2:00:50
the more the surprises can be out of right field that's that's just that's
2:00:56
part of the stock market and that's what makes it a good place to to focus your
2:01:01
efforts if you got the proper temperament for it and a terrible place to get involved if if you get frightened
2:01:08
by markets that decline and get excited when stock markets go up
2:01:14
i don't mean to sound particularly critical i mean I know people have emotions but you got to
2:01:21
check them at the door when you invest
2:01:31
okay station 8 please good morning Mr maf mr greg and
2:01:40
Mr ai my name is Peter Chen i'm from Shanghai China this is my first time
2:01:47
attending this shareholders meeting i would like to ask a question
2:01:53
about the wisdom of life have you ever encountered any major
2:01:59
setbacks or or low points in your life and how did you get through and overcome
2:02:06
them thank you very much well everybody gets setbacks and
2:02:12
uh and some people have particularly bad luck in that respect and others get
2:02:18
through with fairly minors but Charlie you know but uh he had
2:02:26
setbacks I had setbacks i mean it it it's it's part of life and uh and
2:02:32
they're not any fun i don't have any great advice for you about about uh you
2:02:39
know having the time of your life while you're having some major setback but but uh it it you know it it comes with
2:02:47
lifetime you know but uh you certainly have a setback when you
2:02:54
die and so everybody's got that setback guaranteed to them and uh but some
2:03:01
people get and I mean It isn't a laughing matter in a sense because I mean
2:03:07
people get extraordinary bad luck and other people
2:03:12
get extraordinary good luck usually the people who get good luck don't really think it was so much luck as themselves
2:03:19
but but you're just going to have it i think you're going to I think that you're less
2:03:27
likely to have it in terms of medical problems in terms of you know various things in life i mean you were born at a
2:03:34
good time i mean you if you look all the way through the history of China when when would you
2:03:41
rather have been born you know 100 years ago 500 years ago thousand years ago or
2:03:47
now you know it it it's just hands down you'd be lucky i mean you know if if I
2:03:54
came from 20 generations of shepherds I I I think I get kind of tired of you
2:04:00
know my life just looking at these sheep every day but uh you know we can sit
2:04:06
here and I can I can watch Nebraska not quite
2:04:12
played the same game of football that we played 20 years ago but but I mean
2:04:17
everything in life has been made so much better uh that you've got to figure that
2:04:24
you do a lucky store straw by you know staying in the womb for a couple hundred
2:04:30
thousand years and then just emerging at at the right time uh so I would I would
2:04:36
focus on the things that have been good in your life rather than than
2:04:42
than the bad things that happen because bad things do happen but but uh it it it
2:04:49
it's uh it it it can often be a wonderful
2:04:54
life you can get terrible breaks in it i mean you know it uh uh so far that really hasn't happened
2:05:04
with me but it's happened with some of my friends but you get some bad breaks from time to time
2:05:10
uh uh but for 94 years I've been able to
2:05:17
drink whatever I want to drink and you know they they predict all kinds of terrible things for me but it hasn't
2:05:22
happened yet so
2:05:28
and yeah and it's true i mean if you look at
2:05:34
what pro football players are making now and everything compared to what they were making 30 or 40 years ago you can
2:05:41
say "Well isn't that wonderful?" But if you look at the if you look at the lifespan of professional
2:05:48
athletes after a while you get used to really decide that you're better off if
2:05:56
you uh if you really weren't the first one chosen to be on the baseball team or the
2:06:01
basketball team or anything anything else the uh the human body
2:06:09
uh well Charlie and I and I think I speak
2:06:14
for the others to some extent that and we we never didn't we never really
2:06:20
exercised that much or did anything we were we were carefully preserving
2:06:25
ourselves for the years so look at the bright side of things to
2:06:32
the extent that you can and that uh and
2:06:37
you know you're lucky enough to you're here today you're healthy you're you come from a long distance and and uh and
2:06:46
you're getting a chance to learn more about something that interests you and
2:06:52
uh compare that with the situation couple hundred years ago that you would
2:06:58
have been offered so anyway that's enough moralizing
2:07:08
okay Becky uh this question comes from Himmanu Bendal for Ajet and Warren um autonomous
2:07:17
vehicles are already driving across roads in American cities with no driver involvement how do Warren and Ajet think
2:07:24
about any disruption risk from these autonomous vehicles to GEICO's auto insurance business which is built around
2:07:30
understanding and underwriting human drivers wouldn't what we call auto
2:07:36
insurance today just become product liability for autonomous vehicles and autonomous software companies
2:07:45
well a Jeep yeah there's no question that uh insurance for automobiles is
2:07:51
going to change dramatically once self-driving cars become a reality uh
2:07:57
the big change that we will see is what you identified most of the insurance that is
2:08:05
sold and bought revolves around operator errors and how often they happen how
2:08:11
severe they are and therefore what premium we ought to charge to the extent these new self-driving cars are most
2:08:21
safe and are involved in fewer accidents uh that insurance will be less required
2:08:28
instead it'll be substituted by as you mentioned product liability so we at Geico and elsewhere are
2:08:37
certainly trying to get ready for that switch where we move from providing insurance for operator errors and be
2:08:46
more ready to provide protection for product errors and errors and omissions
2:08:51
in the construction of these automobiles yeah we
2:08:58
expect we expect change in all our businesses and uh it's good thing we
2:09:04
didn't and Charlie pushed me into it but uh if I'd settled for being in New
2:09:10
England textiles you know and even though it worked well for 70 years or so prior there too you
2:09:19
know it the world changes and and if the game didn't change at all
2:09:24
really wouldn't be very interesting you know it uh uh if every time
2:09:31
you if you ever every time you you know swung at a baseball you had a home run
2:09:37
the game wouldn't be interesting if every time you hit a golf a golf ball you had a hole in one wouldn't be
2:09:43
interesting so it the fact that there will
2:09:49
be things you have to think about all the time as you go along and you'll make mistakes and all that that's really part
2:09:56
of the fun i mean that your your your brain would turn to mush if you didn't have a few problems now then so
2:10:04
um I I uh you know auto insurance will change
2:10:10
although it's remarkable how little it has changed but it's only been around since
2:10:16
you know a relatively small time and who knows what we're doing to move in
2:10:22
transportation a 100 years from now you go back a couple hundred years ago who could have predicted the United States
2:10:27
would look like what it does and people would move like they do and people would enjoy themselves like they do and I mean
2:10:34
it's just it it it's it's an it's a dynamic world and the biggest thing we
2:10:42
have to worry about unfortunately is that that uh we've learned how to destroy the world too and in in in
2:10:50
in recent years and so we've got this wonderful world which now we we know that there are eight
2:10:58
countries that and probably a ninth coming on that can destroy and and uh uh
2:11:06
and we don't have what I would consider the necessarily the perfect people leading each of one of the nine or or
2:11:13
some of the nine countries and uh you
2:11:19
know when Einstein came up with the equals MC²
2:11:24
back in 1905 he
2:11:29
uh he didn't dream of the fact I mean that energy could really be converted or
2:11:38
uh mass could be converted into energy and the way that we change the world when I was born in 1930 they had known
2:11:46
about the law of physics that that Einstein had come up with
2:11:51
uh 25 years earlier nobody to my knowledge had thought what can this do
2:11:58
to change uh warfare in the future and literally
2:12:05
uh it just wasn't thought einstein didn't think about it at at that point
2:12:11
and uh and then in
2:12:16
1939 Roosevelt got a letter
2:12:22
around month before Germany moved into Poland got around August 1st it's the most famous
2:12:30
letter in history from from Leo Zard leo
2:12:35
Zard couldn't get his letter in front of Roosevelt because who ever heard of Leo Zard it but he got Einstein to sign it
2:12:42
and uh Roosevelt probably understood about as much about physics as I do so he he
2:12:48
didn't understand it but he understood that Einstein signed it so he calls in General Rover may not have been
2:12:56
general then and said "We should do something about this." And and all we
2:13:01
did was learn how to destroy the world and uh we needed to
2:13:06
do it and and uh Germany had Heisenberg and he looked
2:13:13
like he was he was ahead of us and uh
2:13:19
uh we can't put that genie back in the bottle and it's the world does change
2:13:29
and we've got all these one we've got wonderful things but u but we also
2:13:34
have you We have a guy in North Korea if you if we criticize his haircut him you
2:13:42
know who knows what he might decide to do with what does North Korea
2:13:49
need uh nuclear weapons for i mean it
2:13:54
uh can that be a good thing in the world but they're not going to go away so it's
2:14:01
a it's a world of change and we are enjoying incredible change
2:14:10
that's contributed everybody in this room living so much better than people were living a couple hundred years
2:14:15
ago but we haven't been able to to avoid we haven't changed human
2:14:23
beings very much so far we've we've certainly changed weapons of mass
2:14:29
destruction and and uh but we haven't made much progress with the human race
2:14:34
and and uh we'll see what happens with that but in the meantime we'll see changes in
2:14:42
auto insurance too and cars and and uh that that will be be more in it be
2:14:53
easier for us to deal with it than it was when we had to deal with the problems of of turning
2:14:59
out textiles in New England and uh you know you deal with the world as it
2:15:06
develops and like I say everybody here is living in the luckiest period but but
2:15:14
but you know enjoy your luck and uh and
2:15:20
uh and you still try to figure out the answers to what's going to happen in all
2:15:26
insurance as we go along and we've we've done pretty well actually adapting to
2:15:32
the answers there's a few big problems in insurance and uh I don't know how the
2:15:38
insurance industry adapts to them particularly but but that makes the game
2:15:44
interesting you really don't you wouldn't want to go out and play golf if you know you're going to hit the ball in the hole on every hole i'd just like to
2:15:52
add we talked about the shift to product liability and to protection
2:15:58
for accidents that take place because of a error in terms of how the product was designed or supplied uh the only thing I
2:16:07
want to add is in addition to the that shift I think what we'll see is a major shift where the number of accidents that
2:16:15
take place and need to be provided for will drop dramatically because of automatic driving but on the other hand
2:16:22
the cost per repair every time there's an accident the cost of repairing and
2:16:28
bringing everything back to where it used to be would go up very significantly because of the amount of
2:16:33
technology that's going into the uh into the car how those two variables interact
2:16:39
with each other in terms of the total cost of providing the insurance I think is still an open issue
2:16:47
i'll give you two interesting figures to ponder when I walked
2:16:53
into a Geico's office in 1950
2:16:59
the average price of a policy was around 40 bucks a year
2:17:07
uh it varies all over the lot depending on location everything but but uh
2:17:14
uh you know it's pretty easy to get up to $2,000 and depending on how urban
2:17:21
your areas are and uh everything can get considerably higher during that same
2:17:28
time the number of people killed in auto accidents
2:17:33
uh have fallen from roughly six per 100 million miles
2:17:39
driven a little over one so the cars become incredibly
2:17:44
safer and it costs 50 times as much down or
2:17:53
thereabouts to buy insurance policy so uh when people talk about the
2:18:01
developments in car driving and all that sort of thing it it's a lot easier sometimes i
2:18:10
mean the the Buck Rogers aspect of it people look at but they don't actually think of what really happens to the math
2:18:17
of the business the insurance auto insurance industry has been a huge growth industry
2:18:23
and for that matter uh homeowners insurance prices in
2:18:30
Nebraska have doubled in the last 10 years adjusted for general
2:18:36
inflation and uh convective storms you know have
2:18:45
just gone on a tear and it's still unprofitable to write a home b homeowners insurance in Nebraska after
2:18:51
doubling the price in the last 10 years so it's very hard to predict what these big changes mean and
2:19:00
you just got to keep thinking all the time but you don't want to read some research report that says the world's
2:19:05
coming to an end or the world's going to be wonderful because of this or that because there's about 50 other
2:19:12
developments going on at the same time that you uh that you need to think about that uh
2:19:18
and that you needed to keep observing as you go along you don't re you never
2:19:23
reach an answer in this business you reach a point of action that you take but but but
2:19:30
uh we try to get into as high probability things as we think we can do and play the game in the same way but
2:19:38
but but it will be different than you think and and you should wake up every
2:19:44
morning and think about that too if you're if you're in the business of of managing businesses
2:19:50
hey Warren as we approach the break uh would you like to address the operating earnings oh yeah yeah let's put up the
2:19:58
uh we released our 10 Q this morning and
2:20:03
um uh we always try to do it on a Saturday so nobody gets a jump on other
2:20:09
people and we we just have three simple um charts you'll see that
2:20:17
uh our insurance underwriting income was down dramatically for the first quarter
2:20:23
and last year was as good a year as you'll see in insurance that uh uh and
2:20:30
it's always unpredictable in insurance but everything broke our way
2:20:36
uh or the insurance industry's way last year prices are down this year risks are
2:20:43
up this year so you don't have to be a genius to figure out what the answer is
2:20:48
on that so uh but we have we do have unusual
2:20:56
advantages in the insurance business uh that can't really be replicated by
2:21:04
our competition that doesn't mean they aren't trying to get advantages we don't have that but we'll try to replicate
2:21:11
anything that seems better in fact we'll try and top it but we I wouldn't talk about our insurance
2:21:19
business as much as I do it unless I really thought we had some really
2:21:24
permanent advantages in a very very large industry we just announced within
2:21:30
the last 24 hours that we and Zurich and Shub have arranged a joint operation to be
2:21:37
the uh writer of of really
2:21:44
large sums that that very few people can do and of course we got to write them at
2:21:51
the right price in terms of liability but but we can do that sort of thing without blinking and anybody that wants
2:21:58
to do it wants to get us in it i mean it uh so anyway our investment income uh did not
2:22:06
change that much because we have a float that grows a little bit which gives us
2:22:12
more money for investment and then we have retained earnings which grow so we would
2:22:19
expect in any year to have like 40 billion or more that that we'll build up
2:22:25
investments unless we find things uh to do with it so the investment
2:22:31
income rates on treasuries are less than they were or short-term bills I should
2:22:37
say are are less than they were before so you had that negative effect pulling
2:22:42
it down but not that much and we had more money so we came up with a little more earn in the way of earnings the
2:22:48
railroad is earning a little more than than last year but it's not earning what
2:22:53
it it it should be earning at the present time and but that that's solvable and uh and and is getting
2:23:01
getting solved uh and it's still an incredible asset for Bergkshire the
2:23:08
energy company last year was having particular problems and those are absent
2:23:14
this year so those earnings are up and uh and then uh among our range of
2:23:21
general businesses they were pretty much a push and I think I think you did a little calculation the other day on how
2:23:27
many were up and how many were down did great yeah of our uh 49 that we measure
2:23:34
closely uh 20 21 were up and 28 were
2:23:39
down so you can tell it was really a a mixed quarter when you go go across uh
2:23:44
the operating the non- insurance operating businesses yeah the next slide
2:23:52
uh I'm getting a five minute warning here the uh we'll throw the long ball
2:23:58
now the uh uh shows our financial condition which continues
2:24:06
to hold a lot more in cash treasury billables than I would
2:24:11
like but I but that's simply a question of when opportunities occur and
2:24:19
and if you get real opportunities every five or six years you're you know you have to be patient charlie always
2:24:27
pointed out that we made most of our money out of about eight or nine ideas
2:24:32
over 50 years and u and we talked about it every day and we read every report
2:24:38
and we did everything else but but if you think you can get an idea a day from
2:24:43
listening to your friend book or or doing a lot of reading of the of the
2:24:50
financial information published or uh forget it because every now and then you
2:24:57
get extraordinary opportunities and most of the time you don't have much of an edge uh
2:25:05
so uh we also have on that thing our float which continues to build i don't
2:25:13
think any there's no company that has property casualty company that has
2:25:19
our fold is their jeep and yeah clearly we are heads and shoulders above anyone else
2:25:25
yeah it uh so that is money that as long
2:25:31
as we're writing it and underwriting profit is absolutely free money but um
2:25:37
and and we would expect that over a 50 or 100year period that that we would be
2:25:46
able to say the same thing but uh there will be there will be years when you
2:25:52
have a very bad underwriting record and and
2:25:57
it'll lead into the float earnings but so far in the last 20 years I think
2:26:03
uh we've only had what one underwriting loss of any yeah I think if you look at
2:26:09
the entire range including life insurance our cost of float is 2.2
2:26:15
negative that means we've got the float plus somebody's given us 2.2% of that of
2:26:21
cash to Yeah it's like running a running a bank where people leave their money with you and and you pay a minus
2:26:29
2.2% and you don't have any check clearing or anything else to do and it's
2:26:35
included in that so it it but we run our business actually with a different
2:26:41
mindset than than than any other PC company I think probably in the world
2:26:47
and and and I wouldn't be talking about it if I thought they could duplicate it and then
2:26:55
uh the
2:27:01
final final pages on share repurchases and clearly we haven't made any we have
2:27:07
not made share repurchases so far this year and
2:27:13
uh share repurchases if if Bergkshire buys Berkshire shares and repurchases
2:27:19
we've now pay more than you will pay if you buy Bergkshire shares i don't think people generally know that but but there
2:27:26
is a a tax that was introduced here or so ago uh where we
2:27:34
pay 1% and that not only hurts us uh because we pay more for it than you
2:27:40
do to pay it's a better deal for you than for us uh but it actually hurts
2:27:46
some of our investy companies quite substantially and you know Tim Cook has
2:27:52
done a wonderful job i mean really wonderful job running Apple
2:27:59
but he spent a hundred billion dollars roughly in a year repurchasing shares
2:28:05
and there's a 1% charge attached to that now so that that's a billion dollars a
2:28:11
year that he pays when he buys Apple stock in which we like compared to what
2:28:17
you pay and and that doesn't sound like much but well a billion dollars sounds
2:28:22
like a lot still in order but uh there are people that want to increase that
2:28:29
that particular rate dramatically and and uh and you you won't read about it
2:28:36
or anything like that but it does make it slightly less attractive
2:28:41
uh than than it was before and we will only buy in our shares if we think that
2:28:48
they are almost certainly underpriced as
2:28:55
valued very conservatively and and uh uh we get that opportunity occasionally but
2:29:02
the higher that charge goes that the federal government charges us for doing it the less we will be able to do over
2:29:10
purchases so on that happy note we will rejoin uh
2:29:16
at 1:00 and uh uh we will I'm
2:29:25
sorry correct that correct that to 11:00 and then we will yeah 11:00 and then
2:29:31
we'll continue till 1:00 and then in the meantime enjoy yourself and uh uh and I
2:29:39
think all our stores are still open so bring the cash
2:29:45
register here sure I'll help you here okay everyone
2:30:12
okay we're ready to go and uh I'm going to lead
2:30:19
off by uh actually recommending a
2:30:25
movie i know that's why you came but
2:30:31
uh I would recommend to all of you that
2:30:37
u you go to Amazon Prime i've got no financial interest in this but you go to
2:30:45
Amazon Prime and click on a a
2:30:52
documentary called Becoming Katherine Graham it's an incredible story
2:30:59
uh from 50 or so years ago
2:31:04
and to some extent I had the good luck to
2:31:09
be kind of a u a viewer
2:31:15
of some some American history that I I think is fascinating
2:31:22
so if if if you feel that uh that I misled you you can write me a note and I
2:31:30
promise to report how many how many readers didn't agree with but clear to
2:31:36
becoming Kather Graham and you'll see a story of a a remarkable story of
2:31:41
American history and there are a good many portions in there that uh I who lived through that
2:31:50
period didn't know about uh at the time and uh
2:31:57
I think I don't think really every American citizen ought to watch it so with that but
2:32:04
uh I hope you uh all spend some more money out there and
2:32:10
our friendly shops and we will go to station 9
2:32:20
uh hi Warren my name is Robert and I'm a shareholder from uh Toronto Canada uh so
2:32:28
Warren uh three years ago Charlie Rose uh asked you a question to the effect of
2:32:33
what you wanted to be remembered for and your reply was he was a teacher so in
2:32:41
that spirit u Greg I'm curious to hear maybe a story of where you learned something very you know profound from
2:32:49
Warren i'm sure you've learned many things but if there's a story that kind of comes up in your mind we'd love to
2:32:54
hear it and vice versa if we have the time Warren what's something that you
2:32:59
maybe learned from Greg thank you yeah I will turn this over to Greg in just one
2:33:04
second but now the main thing I'd like to be known for is old age
2:33:12
well Ward is uh obviously a remarkable teacher and and I benefit from that
2:33:18
every day and and and as I've already touched on for many years um I'm
2:33:24
fortunate that if I had to uh be remembered as something right now obviously I'd uh want to
2:33:32
be uh remembered as a great father but equally a coach
2:33:39
uh and I and that goes to family friends
2:33:45
and just being involved with uh the kids I coach in hockey or baseball or
2:33:50
whatever it may be i think we've got a a great opportunity to give back to them at uh a very young age so uh obviously
2:33:58
those would be um how I'd want to be remembered and hopefully that'll be uh
2:34:05
uh many many years from now but uh but and I I love thinking of Warren truly as
2:34:11
a teacher and and and he's in every day get the opportunity to continue to learn
2:34:18
warren and I his dialogue is strong every week and we're always talking
2:34:24
around opportunities in Berkshire or things that are going on globally or in the US and each one's uh truly a truly a
2:34:31
learning moment um I I'll maybe go back to the very first meeting with Warren uh
2:34:40
and because it still stands out in my mind obviously it was incredible opportunity we Warren was um buying or
2:34:49
uh acquiring Mid-Americ Energy Holdings Company at that time or or or thinking
2:34:54
about it and we had the I had the opportunity uh with my partners to go over there on a a Saturday morning and
2:35:01
we're discussing the the business and Warren had the financial statements in
2:35:08
front of them and uh like anybody I I was sort of expecting a a few questions on how the
2:35:15
business was performing or a variety of things but Warren locked in immediately
2:35:22
to what was on the balance sheet and the fact we had some derivative contracts
2:35:28
the weapons of mass destruction um and associated with the utility
2:35:35
business we do have them because they they use them to match certain positions and they they're never matched perfectly
2:35:42
but you do have them and we're required in the regulated business but I I just remember Warren going to it immediately
2:35:49
and asking the composition of it and what was the underlying risk in it and wanting to thoroughly under understand
2:35:56
and it wasn't that big of a position but it was absolutely one of the risks he was concerned uh about as he was
2:36:04
acquiring uh Mid-Americ and obviously in light of Enron and everything that gone
2:36:10
on it was a very pertinent question and then the followup to that was then
2:36:17
there's a an energy crisis in the US uh around electricity and natural gas and a
2:36:24
variety of folks were were making significant sums of money this is a year
2:36:31
18 months later and Warren's follow-up question couple years later to me was
2:36:37
and I knew it was more just checking or testing so how much money are we making during this energy crisis are we making
2:36:44
a lot do you know do we are are are are the speculative positions in place and
2:36:49
are we making it the answer was we're really not making any more today than we would have been uh 6 months ago because
2:36:56
all those derivatives were truly to support our business and weren't speculative so just just that focus on
2:37:03
understanding the business of what he was acquiring understanding the risks
2:37:09
around it uh still stand out in my mind warren yeah it's
2:37:15
it's one thing we've really never talked about here but I spend more time looking
2:37:21
at balance sheets than I do income statements and uh uh Wall Street really
2:37:29
doesn't pay much attention to balance sheets but I I like to look at balance sheets
2:37:35
over an 8 or 10 year period before I even look at the income account because
2:37:40
there are certain things it's harder to hide or play games with on the balance sheet than than you can with the income
2:37:47
statement and uh I mean neither one gives you the total answer on anything but but you you
2:37:54
still ought to you ought to understand what the figures are are saying and what they don't say
2:38:01
and what they can't say and what the management would like them to say that the auditors wouldn't like them to say and I mean there's just a lot to be
2:38:07
learned and and you do learn more you learn more from
2:38:13
uh from balance sheets in my view than most people give them credit for uh in
2:38:19
in terms of uh I really
2:38:27
haven't I'm not worried about being remembered about people people don't remember well
2:38:33
they don't remember enough about Katherryn Graham example in in terms of this story that shaped America in many
2:38:41
ways certainly had just all kinds of impact and I I think I mean history
2:38:49
is so fascinating and uh Charlie was
2:38:56
probably the best person you could imagine and what he learned charlie was
2:39:04
never satisfied with
2:39:09
uh just superficial things about any subject he really wanted to understand
2:39:15
it and he always would tell me that you
2:39:20
know don't take a position on anything and until you can describe the arguments
2:39:25
against it better than the person who is arguing with you that you should be able
2:39:33
to argue their case better than they can uh he was he was a remarkable
2:39:40
uh teacher and uh but so and so were those other fellows I mentioned uh
2:39:47
uh I've had a and of course my dad was an incredible teacher
2:39:53
so you make the most of the people you meet that are going to
2:40:02
make you a better person and probably forget about the rest to quite an
2:40:07
extent okay let's move on to number Well Becky you're next
2:40:13
this question comes from David Rubin a shareholder from Scottsdale Arizona uh it's a question for Greg
2:40:21
we've heard over the decades and are familiar with Warren and Charlie's investment thesis and their circle of
2:40:26
competence during the first 10 years after taking over as CEO Greg will be
2:40:32
tasked with allocating more capital during that time than Bergkshire has had to allocate in its history given this
2:40:38
I'd like to hear from Greg about his views on capital allocation particularly into new businesses
2:40:47
sure so um this bar is not too high uh
2:40:53
no it's uh but very fortunate when you think of Berkshire again and we've we've talked
2:41:00
about this where we start from and I I'll I'll clearly touch on the uh
2:41:05
investment and the related investment allocation but we start from a great great place where we've got a a great
2:41:11
culture within the business we have values that we as a management
2:41:17
team and and and really um as defined by Warren and and those Charlie and and
2:41:26
everybody associated with the business we've got great values that really set Birkshop Birkshire up well for the for
2:41:33
the future and obviously as we deploy capital uh and allocate capital it's critical to
2:41:41
Berkshire as we go forward and equally it's around uh managing risk but when I
2:41:48
think of our our our values or our couple that are absolutely
2:41:54
uh critical uh one will maintain the reputation of of Berkshire and and that
2:42:02
of our our company and And I view that in investing or how we operate things uh
2:42:09
across each of our businesses that will always be a priority and something that
2:42:14
will will ensure is in the forefront of our minds i think equally as we then
2:42:22
look at our our various our back to Warren's balance sheet comment we will
2:42:28
have a fortress of a balance sheet and we want to I thought Sue Decker our lead
2:42:36
director said it well yesterday we've got a we've got a significant set of cash right now but it it's an enormous
2:42:44
asset to have that and that will continue to be a philosophy yes when we
2:42:49
can deploy it uh we'll deploy it well and I'll come to that but equally we do
2:42:56
recognize it as a strategic asset and it allows us to weather the difficult times
2:43:02
and and at the same and and and not be dependent on anybody so again that will
2:43:08
be an uh an investment philosophy we will remain Berkshire and we will never
2:43:14
be dependent on a bank or some other party for Bergkshire to be uh successful
2:43:24
i would thank
2:43:30
you i would then move to um to touch on
2:43:35
allocation of capital be absolutely critical but with that comes uh management of risk and and understanding
2:43:43
risk and that falls upon uh all our managers insurance non- insurance but
2:43:49
we'll bring that across Berkshire and then the other value I
2:43:55
would touch on but that really relates to where I'm going is ultimately we have a great set of operating cups companies
2:44:01
that do produce significant cash flows be it in the insurance companies
2:44:06
creating float or our various non- insurance companies producing
2:44:11
significant cash flows on a on an annual basis we intend to continue to ensure
2:44:18
that's a strength of Berkshire as we go forward it's absolutely critical to our
2:44:24
to our long-term success now with those cash flows and with the float and then
2:44:30
equally as touched on we have significant resources already on our balance sheet we'll really continue to
2:44:38
move forward with a very similar philosophy it's an identical philosophy to what we've had uh currently and and
2:44:45
and for the past 60 years we'll start by looking at those
2:44:50
opportunities uh within our business and by that I mean within our insurance non-insurance
2:44:56
businesses are they are they properly capitalized and have the opportunity to manage their business and that uh that
2:45:04
will continue to exist they'll operate in an autonomous way but in the end
2:45:09
Bergkshire still manages the capital that will go into that those businesses or what potentially will come out of
2:45:15
those uh businesses equally the next opportunity
2:45:21
is to acquire businesses in their totality or
2:45:26
100% and there are great times when we can do
2:45:31
that warren touched on we had one that was interesting in the last quarter the 10 billion dollar acquisition but again
2:45:39
the value relative to the risk have to be right and if it's right we want to own it if it's not the time there'll be
2:45:46
another time to own assets like that and then there's the opportunity to own
2:45:52
pieces of uh of companies through the equity but as Warren's always
2:45:57
highlighted and again this will be our approach to to how we think around those
2:46:03
companies though we we own a piece of a company we own a a piece of that uh cash
2:46:12
flow we own a piece of their balance sheet it's not just a a share certificate and as we approach that and
2:46:19
really we'll approach it with the thought that we're going to own this company for the long term um it's again
2:46:26
understanding what be it the 100% company or the 1% company you do we
2:46:33
thoroughly understand and thoroughly do we have a strong view of what those economic prospects of those companies
2:46:40
will look like and Warren said it earlier 5 years from now 10 years from now 20 years from now if if we don't
2:46:48
have a view of that um we won't be investing be it 100% % or
2:46:56
2% of a company through equities we have to thoroughly understand what those prospects look like and associated with
2:47:03
understanding those prospects we need to understand the underlying risk of the
2:47:08
businesses and it's it's really the investment philosophy and and and how we how Warren
2:47:16
and and the team have allocated capital for the p past 60 years you know really
2:47:23
the the it it will not change and it's it's it's the approach we'll take as we
2:47:30
go forward warm yeah i And I don't want to go on too long on this but but Sorry
2:47:38
I covered it no no no but this is this is important because the
2:47:43
uh you know it's it's very obvious um that the country for example needs
2:47:52
uh an incredible improvement rethinking
2:47:58
redirection even to some extent uh in the grid i mean we we've out
2:48:05
outgrown uh what would be the model that America
2:48:13
should have and in a sense it's a problem
2:48:18
something akin to the interstate highway system where you needed
2:48:25
the power of the government really to get things done because it doesn't work
2:48:30
so well when you get 48 or 50 jurisdictions that each has their own
2:48:38
way of thinking about things and of course in World War II we called in people at a dollar an hour and we knew
2:48:45
we had to turn out ships like crazy and we knew that we had to convert Ford Motor from from being a car manufacturer
2:48:52
into an aircraft manufacturer in a matter of days not weeks not months so
2:48:59
you need the there are certain really major investment situations
2:49:06
where we have capital like nobody else has in the private system we have
2:49:13
particular knowhow in in in in the whole generation
2:49:21
uh and and transmission uh arena uh the country is going to need it
2:49:31
uh but we have to figure out a way uh that makes sense from the standpoint
2:49:39
of the government sense from the standpoint of the public and from the standpoint of Birkshire and we haven't
2:49:45
figured that out yet i don't know whether Greg wants to even explain a few
2:49:50
of the major problems but but that is an that is a clear and
2:49:56
present use of hundreds of billions of dollars and you know you have people that set up
2:50:03
funds and so you know they're get they're getting paid for just assembling stuff but it it it's it that's not the
2:50:11
way to handle it the way the way to handle it is to have some kind of a a government private industry cooperation
2:50:19
similar to what you do in in a war and uh and I don't think when they were
2:50:25
doing the highway system I don't think that the government set up its own guys that were going to pour a hole of cement
2:50:31
or anything like that but they you you needed a cooperation and and and we're
2:50:37
at that point I think and uh in in terms of energy but uh I don't
2:50:45
think I don't think we've made any progress particularly though tell us more about that yeah and I think these
2:50:51
are very unique in that not unique in that it's sort of reflective of where we're at there will be very significant
2:50:59
investment opportunities across a variety of industries as Warren touched on in the electric in the electric
2:51:06
industry or the energy space we obviously know that well with our with
2:51:11
our existing business and the capital required to meet the long-term needs of
2:51:17
of of what's um uh currently uh
2:51:22
projected as demand is enormous and and we as Bergkshire will be in a good
2:51:28
position to um help address those needs but the the model around it and the
2:51:34
risks that need to be addressed to deploy that type of capital will be will be different than they are today
2:51:40
warren's point yeah the the muscle of the federal government will be needed
2:51:46
but the test of whether you can have 48 or 50 depending on the nature of things
2:51:53
jurisdictions that are cooperating to do something that has opposition will have opposition in every
2:52:00
single state if they'd taken a vote on during World War II or if they' taken a
2:52:07
vote on the you know the interstate highway system it had it it would have
2:52:12
been slowed down to an incredible degree i so the question is how to use these
2:52:19
strengths that this country has to actually turn it in to what it should be
2:52:27
capable of while still preserving you know a republic with 48 and connected and couple unconnected
2:52:36
states and and it it is it'll be interesting to see what happens but we
2:52:42
do have capital and we actually have some knowledge that that uh very few very few places
2:52:52
have i mean we we we know what the game's about but
2:52:57
uh putting together that energy uh with knowledge and with capital and
2:53:04
everything is it's just not easy uh and it should be something that we're
2:53:09
capable of in the country but but the country was not designed for having in a
2:53:15
certain way it was not designed for having 48 different jurisdictions that could mess up anything that you were
2:53:23
attempting to do and during wartime it's one thing to get agreement but during
2:53:30
during peace time it's some it's it's a it's a different problem that's going to be one for the next generation but I'm
2:53:36
just it's it's important okay station
2:53:46
10 um good morning Mr buffett and Mr
2:53:52
abel i'm Darcus Tang i'm 14 years old my father U Tang MGRTCO brought me here for
2:54:00
two consecutive years and I promise I will come back um every year since I
2:54:06
queue up at 2 in the morning every meeting you hold my dad owned um BRKA shares and he
2:54:15
said I need to work hard to earn my piece of BRKB we are both um are from
2:54:23
China Hong Kong and I would like to ask what's the essential element for a
2:54:31
global teenager like me if we want to be
2:54:36
part of Berkshire like Mr greg Apple like what piece of knowledge I should
2:54:43
learn so you hire me in the future
2:54:50
well if you're talking about the future you better talk to Greg so we'll let Greg answer that
2:54:56
uh my final words finally Mr buffett uh I learned a lot from this meeting and of
2:55:03
course I will come uh here every year and I wish you can attend as many as
2:55:08
possible as you and Mr char Charlie Mer the most respectful people have inspired
2:55:16
me and my father a lot i wish you happy and healthy and maybe one day in the
2:55:24
future we can make the world more prosperous all together like you said
2:55:30
thank you okay thank you
2:55:40
yes uh well I think uh your dad your dad said it best um he highlighted that to
2:55:48
become part of uh uh Berkshire to own some Bergkshire shares you're going to
2:55:53
have to work hard and I think uh hard work takes all of us a long ways in life
2:55:59
and and I would never diminish that you know there's a lot of things that matter
2:56:05
in life but if you start with a great uh work ethic and have that attitude that
2:56:10
you're you want to contribute you're going to go a long ways in life and and that'll and and you'll you'll find great
2:56:18
enjoyment because as Warren said you'll then if you work hard you're going to find the things you love in life and it'll lead to that and uh we we truly uh
2:56:26
look forward to the day you're part of Berkshire thank you
2:56:34
yeah keep keep a lot of curiosity and read a lot as Charlie would say okay
2:56:39
Becky uh this question comes from Matthew Teisac in Leighton Utah he said "Please
2:56:46
discuss your strategy on how to protect our company from future liabilities due to wildfires blamed on our electric
2:56:54
utility companies out west." Well that's a very good question and uh
2:57:02
uh we've we we made some mistakes in the
2:57:07
past when we bought Pacific Corp in 200 what five U yes Warner Scott and
2:57:14
and David Sol and myself three guys who were capitalists at heart and had had uh
2:57:22
but we're dealing with our own money but we uh we made a mistake by not carving
2:57:28
it up into the seven states that we were buying and uh it came it came with an
2:57:34
aggregation uh where it wasn't state by state and we
2:57:40
we kept the same the same structure and that was a that was a big mistake
2:57:48
uh there are well every part of the country is going
2:57:55
to need electricity and there are going to be places where where public electric or
2:58:01
privately held electric utilities would be very foolish to operate and how that gets resolved in a democracy we will
2:58:08
find out but uh uh those are the facts as they stand now I would say Greg
2:58:16
yeah the the reality the risk around the wildfires i.e that do the wildfires
2:58:22
occur are they're not going away and and we know that and the risk probably goes
2:58:27
up each year so but what we can do to reduce the risk of it impacting our
2:58:33
system and our underlying assets and the unfortunately the liabilities that come
2:58:38
with such events we can change that and manage that we can't eliminate the risk
2:58:44
but we can reduce it and that's where we've got uh our teams in the in the
2:58:51
west but we really are approaching it across all our energy infrastructure because the the reality is the wildfires
2:58:59
have now occurred in uh Texas they've had a variety of them throughout the US
2:59:04
and and we're all very focused on how we manage that risk how we manage it is we
2:59:10
start by addressing the actual assets how we're maintaining them um and where
2:59:18
we invest them invest into them so we try to make sure that they're either not
2:59:24
causing the fire or potentially even hardening the system as to what can they
2:59:30
withstand so it's very much uh we start with the operational folk uh focus we
2:59:37
then take it even further and this is something Warren and I've discussed many times is that the utilities started to
2:59:44
recognize when we have these unusual weather events and Warren touched on what's been happening in Nebraska with
2:59:50
storms but they're equally occurring uh or or significant events occurring uh
2:59:57
west but when we have those we've gotten very very good at saying okay we have to manage the system differently will
3:00:03
potentially deenergize because there's likely to be an event but the one thing we hadn't tackled and this is very
3:00:10
relevant to the one significant event we had back in 2020 in Pacific Corp is we
3:00:16
didn't deenergize the system as the fire was approaching uh because our our employees and the
3:00:23
whole management team have been all their lives trained to keep the lights on and the last thing they want to do is
3:00:30
turn those lights off and and have a system deenergized and after those events and as we
3:00:39
um really looked at how we're going to move forward in in managing the the assets and reducing that risk we we have
3:00:47
clearly recognized as as a team that we have to deenergize those assets so now
3:00:53
as we get fires encroaching at a certain uh number of miles we deenergize cuz we
3:00:59
do not want to contribute to the fire nor obviously harm any of our consumers
3:01:04
or contribute unfortunately if there's a death and and that's really where we had to take our team that we're managing a
3:01:10
different risk now it's not around keeping the lights on it's around protecting the general public and
3:01:16
ensuring the fire does not spread further so we've gone as far as that
3:01:21
and I would I'll stand corrected on this one but we're probably the one uh
3:01:28
utility or across our utilities that does that today and we strongly believe
3:01:33
that becky can I just follow up on that yeah doesn't that open you up to other risk if you shut down your system a
3:01:40
hospital gets shut down somebody dies we're we we've uh you know fortunately
3:01:45
that's something that we do deal with a lot because we have power outages that occur by accident so when we look at
3:01:52
critical infrastructure because it's excellent point and we're constantly re-evaluating it and we do receive a lot
3:01:58
of feedback from our customer groups as to how do we manage that but that is
3:02:03
something we deal with on a a more routine basis than we'd ever like the lights go out they have to make sure the
3:02:09
hospitals stay on emergency units can respond and all that uh but there is
3:02:14
risk there so then we spend a lot more time educating the consumers and our consumer groups our customers okay this
3:02:23
is what will happen we need to understand your unusual situations and how can we best tackle that again so we
3:02:30
just don't take on another liability so there's a lot around uh
3:02:36
deenergization and then just to take it to the last step and Warren's touched on that just in general on energy policy we
3:02:45
have to work with our states and our regulators to ensure this was never risk we took on or
3:02:52
or envisioned when we were investing in utilities nor would any of the investors
3:02:57
who've invested in other energy companies you earn a you you earn a very
3:03:02
set return for taking on a very set defined risk associated with that asset
3:03:11
and this has gone well beyond that we don't earn the type of returns nor can you earn a large enough return to take
3:03:17
on these risks so it's it's not just about solving the return side we really have to solve the risk side which means
3:03:24
we work with our regulators we're working with our state legislators to get to the right answer and that's
3:03:31
really just that'll be an ongoing process there are not silver bullets out there but every day our teams across
3:03:37
utilities are working hard to reduce that risk recognizing the fundamental risk of the wildfires is not going away
3:03:46
but there's some problem yeah there's some there's some problems that can't be solved and we we shouldn't be in the
3:03:53
business of taking your money investors money and and and tackling things that we don't know the solution for and um
3:04:02
uh and you can present the arguments but it's a political decision when you are
3:04:09
dealing with states or the federal government and uh uh if you're in
3:04:15
something where you're going to lose the big thing to do is quit and you you
3:04:20
present your case as well as you can and everything else but uh if you don't hold the pen in the end
3:04:28
uh you know we don't have any business taking your money and uh doing dumb
3:04:36
things with us and and we can do our best to explain what the intelligent things are but
3:04:43
uh it's your money and uh uh so it's
3:04:49
it's very hard to tell how to to handle the questions of politically determined
3:04:57
decisions that are going to go to court in many cases but you know that
3:05:05
that it just doesn't it doesn't make sense we we know
3:05:11
what we think a sensible system would be but and we ought to explain what what
3:05:17
what we think it is and and uh uh you know do the best to get our position
3:05:24
because it's pro social to have the right solution to have it
3:05:29
but uh the right solution for example in the interstate wasn't to let 48 states
3:05:37
each decide on their own way of doing it and award contractors the jobs based you
3:05:43
know there's just there's some problems that can't that can't be solved and we
3:05:49
are not in the business of trying to solve insolvable problems yeah i'd even
3:05:55
go for but then the problem you have of course is that the people that work for you that's it's their job so they they
3:06:02
they they want to have reasons to keep going
3:06:07
and uh that's a that's a it's those are tough choices if you're managing but
3:06:13
that's what's that's why they have managers and Warren I was just going to add because you touched on something really
3:06:19
important there that um effectively is for example with the utilities and the wildfires
3:06:25
um we c we can't just become the insurer of last resort and that we're going to
3:06:31
cover any cost and all costs irrespective of what occurred and that's a little bit of the
3:06:38
situation we're in right now with our largest uh challenge a 2020 wildfire
3:06:43
where there were one of four fi there were four fires occurring at a a
3:06:48
challenging time one we've always asserted was a lightning strike that was
3:06:54
not inside our service territory the fire burnt into our service territory
3:07:00
and we became responsible for that fire effectively through the courts and we've
3:07:05
continue to hold firm that we're not responsible for that um rightfully I mean we didn't
3:07:12
contribute to it uh and we didn't initiate it nor did we feel we ever contributed to it um but it's getting uh
3:07:21
again if you look at the risk that's there we have to manage through things like that we'll get through that
3:07:27
litigation we're happy to report for example on that one after 5 years the
3:07:32
Oregon Forestry Department has come out and said the the the fires the other
3:07:37
fires we did have that we were able to manage and extinguish did not contribute to that fire and that fourth fire is the
3:07:45
largest fire of the four it can it's 60% of the claims we're 5 years into
3:07:51
effectively getting that information into the courts now that will outline
3:07:56
our legal strategy obviously going forward but it's things we're dealing with but we continue to learn from this
3:08:02
as a as utility industry so we're in very much each of the legislators as I
3:08:08
said making sure we get clear definition where liability falls what can the
3:08:15
economic damages be but most importantly what can the non-economic damages be and
3:08:21
again with the thought we can't be the insurer of last resort we just can't be
3:08:26
responsible for everything that happens in in a state
3:08:31
if we want to do it with our own money we we can do it but we're not going to we're not going to do things with your
3:08:37
money that we think are stupid i mean you ought to get rid of us if if if if
3:08:43
we do it and uh it's easy to it's easier to do stupid things with other people's
3:08:49
money than it is with your own money that's one of the problems government has just generally we don't want to bring it to private enterprise
3:09:02
but it is important that the United States have an
3:09:08
intelligent energy policy just as it was important during World War II that we
3:09:14
learned how to make ships instead of cars extremely fast and we figured out
3:09:20
the answer we combined private enterprise with with with with the power of the of of of
3:09:27
government and uh but what how feasible that is in a in
3:09:33
a democracy and you know it it was clearly obvious during World War needed
3:09:40
to be done and we did it but it's not so clear when when uh you get
3:09:49
330 million people all arguing their own self-interest and and of course deciding
3:09:56
what'll happen and and and having the people often who are making the
3:10:03
decisions reacting as they did 20 years earlier uh you know when they don't
3:10:09
really bear the responsibility for the decision but u anyway that's management
3:10:15
and um we'll do our best station 11
3:10:25
hello my name is Alitia Burk and I'm from Poland but I currently live in Chicago this question is on behalf of an
3:10:32
inspiring man that I know Wid Ahmed who's here with us today mr buffett
3:10:37
nearly 74 years ago on a cold Saturday in January 1951 you traveled 8 hours by
3:10:44
train from New York to Washington you won all the way on nothing but hope that
3:10:49
some might teach you more about the insurance industry arriving at Geico's office to find the doors locked you
3:10:56
persisted until a janitor let you inside you credit that meeting with Lori Davidson for the insurance float that
3:11:04
was the rocket fuel behind Berkshire's success in 2011 when I was 15 I wrote
3:11:10
you with similar determination asking to meet you kindly wrote back saying you had only 3,000 days left and more
3:11:17
pressing priorities well Mr buffett it's now been 5,000 days since you
3:11:24
replied and so inspired by your persistence in 1951 and the tenacity of
3:11:31
Mrs b I humbly renew her my request for just a quarter of the time Davey gave
3:11:36
you a single hour in your office oh well you may wonder why must it be you you
3:11:42
have often shared an anecdote about Polish Jew who survived Ashvitz who said to you once Warren I'm very slow to make
3:11:50
friends because when I look at someone I ask myself would they hide me you said that the number of people would hide you
3:11:57
was the best test of life well lived well I believe that the at this meeting you have four you don't have 40,000
3:12:04
trail holders but you have 40,000 people who would hide you you are testament to
3:12:09
a life extraordinarily well-lived yet even you have not fully witnessed this
3:12:15
transformative power of a I'll let you write I'll I'll let you write my biography but I I think I've got the
3:12:20
point of your question so respectfully I ask again Mr buffett
3:12:27
before father time wins will you please grant will lead Ahmed an hour of your
3:12:32
time or any time you can dedicate thank you so much for your time thank you and
3:12:37
and I will say this I grant an hour to everybody of the 40,000 here well will
3:12:43
we'll have an interesting I'll have an interesting time the rest of my life but I will I
3:12:49
will I'll give you one tip uh I found
3:12:54
that when I was very young and
3:12:59
uh I would I would drive around to various companies all over the country
3:13:06
and uh because I was very young and these were companies
3:13:13
were offbeat and they didn't have investor relations departments then
3:13:18
almost every CEO would see me cuz they figured I'd never they'd never see me again and uh uh and they didn't they
3:13:27
weren't getting calls like that and I would ask them two questions i I would I
3:13:33
would explain to them it's not a bad idea incidentally uh if you're going to walk into
3:13:38
somebody's office and you say you want 10 minutes of their time take a
3:13:44
u hourglass and stick it on the on the desk of the person you're talking to and
3:13:50
turn it up so it's going to go for 10 minutes and you say you're going to you're going to leave in 10 minutes
3:13:55
unless they ask you to stay and uh uh that sets the terms but then once you
3:14:01
have that you if if they're in the coal business we'll say which happened to be
3:14:07
one that I was interested in 70 years ago or so uh you just ask them one
3:14:13
question that if they were to be stuck on a desert island and they had
3:14:20
to own only one of their competitors
3:14:25
stock during the 10 years they were going to be on that island which one would it be and Why and then after they give you that
3:14:32
answer you said the same thing you were in the short uh your net worth while you were on the
3:14:38
island which would it be and why because every manager likes to talk about their competitors they're they're they're like
3:14:45
went to school kids you know when when they get into talking about their competitors
3:14:50
i probably learned more about various industries by just making sure that they
3:14:56
didn't think I'd stay too long and that in the meantime they would have the floor and talk about their competitors i
3:15:02
kept my own mouth shut in those days uh that's that's a lesson I've lost
3:15:07
somewhere along the line but the uh uh you're you're not you're you
3:15:16
essentially they've outsourced uh or I shouldn't say outsourced but
3:15:21
they've they've departmentalized investor relations of all companies of
3:15:27
size frankly now so you've got you know 3,000 companies or whatever they have
3:15:32
and they all have departments and each one of them has an investor relations department practically and their job is
3:15:38
to say this is the best thing you can do today is buy our stock well that the whole concept is total idiocy uh but
3:15:46
it's a big business and it gets bigger and the investor relations department gets bigger and and uh you know and and
3:15:55
it uh it's what we have now but do a little of your own work your own way but
3:16:03
uh Bergkshire Hathaway has got plenty of material out there for you to read and when you get through reading it all
3:16:09
you'll know way more than most the people that work at Bergkshire so uh you you don't need a personal
3:16:16
interview if we take it if we take an hour times even the
3:16:22
40,000 people we may have here plus plus Becky's many listeners and
3:16:29
viewers uh it just doesn't work so uh I admire I admire your effort but but uh
3:16:37
but you'll just have to settle for that is the admiration that you get in this
3:16:49
okay Becky um this is a question that you touched
3:16:54
on in a lot of ways in the last answer um from before but I did get this
3:17:00
question from a few different people so I'd like to ask it ricardo Bri a longtime shareholder based in Panama
3:17:06
says that he was very happy to see Berkshire acquire 100% of BAG um it was
3:17:12
done in two steps one in late 2022 1% was purchased from Greg Ael for $870
3:17:19
million implying a valuation of BHE of $87 billion and then two in 2024 the
3:17:26
remaining 8% was purchased from the family of Walter Scott Jr for $3.9 billion implying a valuation of $48.8
3:17:35
billion for the enterprise that second larger transaction represented a 44%
3:17:41
reduction in valuation in just 2 years ricardo writes that Pacific Corp liabilities seemed too small to explain
3:17:48
this therefore what factors contributed to the difference in value for BHE between those two moments in time well
3:17:55
we don't know how much we'll lose out of Pacific Court and decisions that are made but we also know that that certain
3:18:03
of the attitudes demonstrated uh by that particular
3:18:10
example have got analoges throughout the utility system
3:18:16
and and uh we there's a lot of there's a lot of
3:18:22
states that that so far have been very good decent to operate in and there are
3:18:29
some now they're rat poison as Charlie would say to operate in and
3:18:34
uh that knowledge was was accentuated when we saw what happened in
3:18:43
the Pacific Northwest and it's extent accentuated by what we've seen as to how
3:18:48
utilities have been treated in certain other situations uh and then on top of
3:18:54
that so that it wasn't just a direct question of what was involved at Pacific Corp it was an extrapolation of of a
3:19:03
societal trend and secondly we uh uh
3:19:10
also had a decision we didn't expect out at all in the real estate uh business
3:19:17
and and and those kind of things can change values and courts can change values and it's a lot easier to make
3:19:25
those decisions when you just own marketable securities than when you own businesses uh and I've made plenty of those
3:19:32
decisions as I've watched what have happened in various industries and companies and over 70 years but
3:19:42
uh Greg made the decision which was fine with us to get out while and he had no
3:19:49
knowledge of what was going to be happening in either the real estate field or the utility field and uh uh we
3:19:58
would we We're not in the mood to sell any business but but Birkshire Hathaway Energy is worth
3:20:06
considerably less money than it was two years ago based on societal factors and
3:20:13
that happens in some of our businesses it certainly happened to our textile business and it's it's
3:20:19
happened it's the public utility business is not as good a business as it was a couple of years ago and uh if if
3:20:29
anybody doesn't believe that they can look at Hawaiian and electric and they look and look at the Edison in the
3:20:34
current wildfires situation in California and and uh there's societal trend trends
3:20:42
that are uh oh I just got a note here on my monitor says the books
3:20:47
are now sold out so uh you'll have to spend your money on other things here's fudge this is what
3:20:54
I'm eating something uh but that's the explanation
3:21:00
that values change and they don't always change upward and uh when we made the
3:21:07
deal with with Greg we would have would happy to buy out uh Scott family at that
3:21:13
price and when we made a deal with the Scott company we wouldn't have been happy to pay Greg the price that he
3:21:19
received but that that's like Bergkshire shares we bought in stock at X and we
3:21:24
buy in stock at at less than X if if if conditions change poor and we pay
3:21:32
over the years we pay more and more because it builds in value but it doesn't do it in a straight
3:21:39
line and I would say that our enthusiasm for buying public utility companies is
3:21:45
different than it now than it would be would have been a couple years ago
3:21:54
that happens in other industries too but it's pretty dramatic in public utilities and it's particularly dramatic in public
3:22:00
utilities because they are going to need lots of money so if you're going to need
3:22:06
lots of money you probably ought to behave in a way that encourages people to give you lots of money and and uh we
3:22:13
will see where we go
3:22:18
it we'd like to see public utilities do well but we our responsibilities to the
3:22:24
shareholders of Burggerway okay
3:22:29
station station one
3:22:37
again dear Warren dear Greg dear fellow owners it's such a pleasure to be here
3:22:43
my name is Revie Panida i was born in communist Albania but I'm now teaching economics in London England uh the
3:22:50
wonderful writing of Warren and Charlie has significantly shaped my thinking and teaching i thank you both very much for
3:22:57
the many insights over the years warren has often written about the importance of Bergkshire's earning power to owners
3:23:04
my question is what was in your estimate Burks's earning power in the latest fiscal year it would be great if you can
3:23:11
comment on any significant items that either increased or decreased the earning power as compared to reported
3:23:17
net uh income measures for Bircher thank you yeah well I think our underlying
3:23:24
earning power was affected negatively here a while back by what happened in the utility field i think that our
3:23:33
earning power was not is not enlarged by any large
3:23:40
acquisitions that come along but they come along periodically so we will see something at some point that that uh
3:23:49
well could be you know on the one that was 10 billion we would have added to
3:23:54
earning power i mean why else would we do it uh uh
3:24:00
so that's that's very uh
3:24:06
situational and of course it depends so much on what the general market is doing and what interest rates are doing and
3:24:12
what psychology is doing we will make our best deals when people are the most pessimistic you know that's been
3:24:19
true ever since I was 1930 born in 1930
3:24:24
when I was born things got much more attractive over the next two years and apparently I
3:24:31
didn't do anything about it there but uh you know that was the opportunity of a
3:24:38
lifetime and and I blew it by you know worrying about the kid in
3:24:44
the next crib or something but uh uh over my
3:24:51
lifetime you know I've had fabulous opportunities sometimes and
3:24:57
and they happen because humans are human and
3:25:03
uh I don't you know I'm fearful of all kinds of things i don't want to try and
3:25:09
you know be one of the Wendas and walk on a tiny strip between couple of twin
3:25:16
towers or something or whatever it may be but I don't get I don't I I just I I
3:25:23
don't get fearful by things that that other people get are afraid of in in in
3:25:29
the financial in a financial way that uh you know the idea
3:25:34
that if Bergkshire went let's say Bergkshire went down 50%
3:25:39
uh next week i would regard that as a fantastic opportunity and and it
3:25:45
wouldn't bother me in the least and and most people aren't they just react
3:25:50
differently uh and so it doesn't it's not that I don't have emotions but I don't have emotions about
3:25:57
the prices of stocks i mean I actually those decisions get all the way to my
3:26:03
brain whereas emotions can get bogged down some other place so
3:26:10
uh uh Bureau will increase its earning power over time as we retain money i
3:26:18
mean we we are doing things making decisions every day people
3:26:23
are working we're retaining earnings we we will build the earning power but it won't be coming in in any even stream
3:26:33
and it certainly won't be matched dollar for dollar on either the upside or the
3:26:38
downside and market prices and but that's what makes it a good business you know the investment business is that
3:26:46
everything isn't properly appraised and and the seller other people get the
3:26:51
better your opportunities get
3:26:58
okay Becky this question comes from Achie Patel and
3:27:04
it's about the big cap technology stocks in the 2017 annual meeting you said
3:27:10
Warren you really don't need any money to run these companies and referred to them as ideal businesses referring to
3:27:18
the big tech companies Apple Alphabet Microsoft and Amazon with all of those
3:27:23
companies now announcing massive capital investment endeavors and a around AI
3:27:29
ambitions have you rethought the above comment just in terms of them being asset light and what you think of them
3:27:35
as a result well it's always better to make a lot of money with without putting up anything uh than it is to make a lot
3:27:42
of money by putting up a lot of money and so a business that takes no capital
3:27:48
to speak of um Coca-Cola it
3:27:55
the the finished product which has gone through bottling companies and everything that takes a lot of capital
3:28:02
but in terms of the selling the syrup or the concentrate that goes to it doesn't
3:28:09
take a lot of capital so one is a fabulous business and one is a you know
3:28:15
it depends where it is and everything like that coco is popular every place but some places it I mean if you're in
3:28:22
the bottling business it costs real money you have real trucks out there and you have all kinds of machinery and and and you have capital expenditures coming
3:28:29
up and you know we've got businesses that take very little capital that make
3:28:37
high re really high returns on capital and and the ones the politicians talk
3:28:43
about as making high returns actually aren't making high returns usually in terms of capital uh
3:28:54
uh insurance property casual insurance is kind of a rare business because you need capital as a guarantee fund that
3:29:03
you will keep your promises but you can use it to buy other low intensive
3:29:11
capital business i mean you can you can buy a whole you can buy Apple and that would support that business so uh that
3:29:18
can be a pretty good business and it's one of the reasons we've done well over time uh but
3:29:27
uh [Music] the well it'll be interesting to see how
3:29:32
much capital intensity there certainly there's more capital intensity going on with the Magnificent 7 than there were
3:29:40
was a few years ago i mean basically Apple
3:29:45
uh has not really needed any any capital over the years and it's repurchased
3:29:52
shares that a dramatic amount of reduction whether that world is the same
3:29:58
in the future or not is something Hollywood's answer was always
3:30:04
to get their their money from other people to put up the capital it uh a lot of
3:30:12
people have gotten very rich in the country by essentially figuring out how
3:30:18
out how to get others put up the capital uh and that's what people do in the in
3:30:25
the money management business and they get very very rich because they they get
3:30:30
an override on other people's capital uh and incidentally if if all of you were
3:30:38
paying 1% for investment management fees at Berkshire last year you would
3:30:44
have paid $8 billion uh for managing and and you really
3:30:49
wouldn't have had to do it but uh you know investment management is a
3:30:55
very good game because other people put up the capital and you you charge them
3:31:00
for the capital whether they do well or not and then you charge them a lot more if they do well i mean it uh it it
3:31:09
uh it's uh it's a welldesigned business for the people who
3:31:16
practice it uh and who can blame them i mean that's that is capitalism but
3:31:25
uh and I I saw that in operation when I was working at Solomon but I didn't need
3:31:31
to see it i I knew what existed anyway the trick in life is to get somebody else's capital and get an override on
3:31:40
it uh Charlie and I decided it wasn't too
3:31:45
elegant a business after a while we we weren't we were not criticizing the efficacy of it we were just it just
3:31:52
didn't appeal to us after a while i did it for 12 years though or
3:31:58
something like not really the the one difference that Charlie and I did from other people is we put all our own money
3:32:04
in into it so so we really we did share the losses in with our own capital but
3:32:10
we got an override on other people's capital and that's been people have made
3:32:17
advances where they get the override on other people's capital without putting up any of their own capital to speak of
3:32:24
and that's that's a very good business but
3:32:29
uh it it it leads it it can lead to a lot
3:32:35
of abuse greg you've watched capital
3:32:40
management in the United States and would you say that Canada's behind or
3:32:46
ahead in this respect well I think when it comes to their
3:32:51
capital system Warren it it it is very comparable there's no question other
3:32:57
than as as we know I mean I think the US as far as having uh a capitalist system
3:33:03
it would it would be tough to be touched by uh any country and I think when I
3:33:09
think of Canada there's just certain responsibilities or the or
3:33:14
obligations that the government wants to take on and aren't going to leave with the public sector and that's just a a
3:33:21
decision that's made by society or by the by the Canadian people or if you
3:33:26
look at another country Australia wherever it may be but so there's it's different but when you think when I
3:33:33
think of capitalism that that drive is there and and and and the desire to you
3:33:40
know allocate capital properly it's very similar it it's produced wonders in the
3:33:46
United States if you think about it but uh originally
3:33:52
uh with the Rockerfellers and Kennedy and and and Carnegies and all they
3:33:57
actually put up money to build steel mill you know whatever it may have been
3:34:04
with with Roger refineries and pipelines and all that sort of thing they they put
3:34:11
up money to do it now the trick is to use other people's money basically and and
3:34:17
uh and you know you can't you can't blame human be beings for behaving like
3:34:25
humans but you should be aware of what their motivations are it's a capitalism
3:34:33
in the United States has succeeded like nothing you've ever seen but it has the
3:34:38
what it is is it's a combination of this magnificent cathedral which has produced
3:34:45
an economy like nothing the world's ever seen and then it's got this massive casino attached so you got the cathedral
3:34:51
and the casino and in the casino everybody's having a good time and there's lots of money changing hands and
3:34:57
everything but the cathedral is what got to make sure the cathedral gets gets fed too because the temptation and the
3:35:05
temptation's very high now is to go over to the casino where people say you know we've got magic boxes and all kinds of
3:35:12
things that'll do wonderful things for you and that's where people are happiest that's where you get the most promise to
3:35:17
you that's where the most money is for the people that are pushing things and
3:35:23
uh you know the balance between the capital casino and the u and the
3:35:28
cathedral are it's very important that that uh the United States in the next
3:35:34
hundred years make sure that the cathedral is not overtaken by the casino
3:35:39
cuz people really like to go to casinos and it's just so much more fun
3:35:45
and they they bring bells and when you win and you know they they bring you drinks and everything else and and uh
3:35:55
uh it's it's designed to move money from one pocket to another but um and in the
3:36:02
cathedrals they basically are designing things that will be be producing goods and
3:36:08
services for 300 and some million people like
3:36:13
it's never been done before in in history uh it's an interesting system we've
3:36:20
developed but it's worked it it it dispenses
3:36:27
rewards in what seems like a terribly capriccious manner i mean it the idea
3:36:33
that people get what they deserve in life and it it's hard to make that
3:36:38
argument uh uh but if you argue with it any other
3:36:45
system where it seems to work better the answer is we haven't found one so I'll
3:36:50
leave it to the next generation to to send me the answer and then by Ouija
3:36:55
board or whatever works okay station two
3:37:06
hi my name is Patrick Nester i am 13 years old and from Tampa Florida i'm
3:37:12
here with my brother John who's 15 and my dad thank you for hosting this
3:37:17
meeting this is my first ever shareholder meeting my question is what
3:37:22
high school class or activity helped influences you to who you are today as
3:37:27
the greatest investor of investor of all time
3:37:33
well that's good question
3:37:38
uh the the teachers you get in your life have this incredible impression and on
3:37:45
you and and a lot of it are the formal teachers you have but some are informal
3:37:51
teachers too I mean I learned from certain employers you know so much
3:37:57
uh you really hope you're learning from everybody you find who's well-intentioned and has had a lot of
3:38:04
experience in And I I had a lot of good luck in that but I would I would say that
3:38:13
uh what what well where I was really lucky was my dad was in the investment
3:38:19
business so I would go down on Saturday and I'd wait for him to go to lunch with
3:38:26
and I'd read the books that were around there that nobody else ever read and uh
3:38:31
uh and they just they talked to me numbers talk to me uh and uh
3:38:38
uh I could never get my fill of them and then I discovered the public library and I read every book there was on
3:38:45
investments literally in the Elmo public library at 19 and uh
3:38:52
uh you know I just I I enjoyed learning about that unlike
3:38:58
Charlie if Charlie was reading about electricity he would want
3:39:04
to have known everything that Thomas Edison knew and more and and goes through the same thought processes and
3:39:10
understand how everything worked i didn't care whether how it worked i just cared whether it worked and that's a
3:39:16
limitation i'm I'm I'm confessing here i'm not bragging uh uh
3:39:22
but I you know the as as Charlie would say I mean people would always say if
3:39:28
you could only have lunch with one person living or dead who would it be and Charlie said I've already had lunch
3:39:35
with all of them because I've read all their books you know basically and and so and he really did it i think
3:39:42
having curiosity and and actually finding sympathetic teachers is very useful i I
3:39:50
I ran into a couple of teachers that uh both in high school and college in
3:39:56
fact I would say that I went to three different higher you know three
3:40:02
different universities and I went to high school in Washington and at each
3:40:09
place I found about two or three really outstanding people and uh and I just
3:40:18
spent my time with them and didn't pay much attention to the other classes and uh and I was lucky to find something
3:40:25
that that really fit me very early uh on
3:40:31
if my ambition had been to become a ventriloquist or you know whatever the
3:40:36
hell it might have been and it wouldn't have worked you know I' I'd have spent hours and hours and hours and I wouldn't
3:40:42
have been any good when I got through so I don't believe that I think there was that book that
3:40:48
talked about spending 10,000 hours at something I could spend 10,000 hours at
3:40:54
tap dancing and and and you'd throw up if you watched me you know but but if I
3:40:59
spent if I spent a 10 hours reading Ben Graham I would I would be damn smarter
3:41:05
when I got through so minds are really really different i watch great bridge
3:41:11
players and I watch great physicians great I mean people really really really
3:41:19
have different talents and uh you know I don't know I think you're supposed to
3:41:25
have 88 billion cells in your brain i'm not sure that all of mine are flashing
3:41:33
bright lights but but you are different than anybody else
3:41:39
that's what my dad always used to to tell me that uh essentially that you know you're something different
3:41:47
it may not be good at the moment but but uh you you find your own you find your
3:41:54
own path and you will you will find the people in schooling that that want to
3:42:03
talk to you people that teach in general they love having uh a young
3:42:11
student who's actually really interested in the subject and they'll spend extra time with you they'll do all kinds of
3:42:17
things that and I I ran into that i had Graham and Dodd at at uh Columbia well
3:42:25
Dave Dodd treated me like a son basically and uh uh but I was interested
3:42:31
in excuse me I was just in what they were saying and and they found it kind of
3:42:38
entertaining that I was so interested and uh so I would just I would I I would
3:42:46
look around at you and you know what really fascinates you i wouldn't try and
3:42:51
be somebody else and then I would u you you'll find the teachers uh at a
3:42:59
school and and you'll find some outstanding people that that are
3:43:04
teachers i' I've had at least 10 people that have had huge impacts on my life and every one of
3:43:13
them was positive you know because I got to select in a sense and and uh
3:43:20
and a a number of people really like helping younger people you know i found
3:43:27
that in school and probably helps to look a little bit lost and all that like
3:43:34
you need help uh but I I uh I would say my school
3:43:40
experiences were good but were really very good
3:43:46
but I attribute it much more to the individual than to the
3:43:55
institutions okay i've already told you more than I know so we'll go on to
3:44:02
uh Becky you're next this question comes from Scott Williams in Portland Oregon
3:44:08
he said "Do you think the net benefit of Doge will be positive or negative for the long-term health of the United
3:44:16
States?" Well why don't you give me a hard one
3:44:22
i think that I think that
3:44:27
bureaucracy is something that is
3:44:33
amazingly prevalent and contagious even in our capital system and that big
3:44:41
corporations you know
3:44:47
overwhelmingly most of them look like they could be run better i'm sure Bergkshire does in many way many
3:44:52
respects and uh it it
3:44:58
uh you know and government is the ultimate so it it it it really doesn't
3:45:04
have any checks on it uh and that's why it scares you to some
3:45:11
extent about uh about uh what the future of the currency will be
3:45:17
because they can print currency and and if you have people
3:45:24
that get elected by promising people things and that doesn't mean that that
3:45:29
they aren't sincere about all kinds of items but there's no
3:45:36
politician that says to anybody that at least if they have money that you know I
3:45:42
really think you have bad breath and if you don't mind would you step over away from me it just doesn't happen they uh
3:45:49
and so I I think the problem of how you control
3:45:55
revenue and expenses in government is the one that is never fully solved and has
3:46:06
had really hurt dramatically certain many
3:46:11
civilizations and I don't think we're immune from it and we've come close to it
3:46:17
uh but if you tell me how in in in a
3:46:24
democracy you go in and really change things you know we're we're operating at
3:46:29
a fiscal deficit now that is unsustainable over a very long period of time we don't know whether that means
3:46:35
two years or 20 years that because there's never been a country like the United States but
3:46:43
uh you know that if something can't go on forever it will end to quote Herbert
3:46:49
Stein famous uh economist and uh we are
3:46:55
doing something that is unsustainable and and it has the it has the aspect to it that it gets
3:47:03
uncontrollable pull able to a certain point i mean essentially you just give up on it and uh Paul Vulker you know
3:47:14
kept that from happening in the United States uh but we came close we've come close multiple times and
3:47:22
uh you know the we've still
3:47:28
had very substantial inflation in the United States but it's never been run away yet and and that's not something
3:47:36
you want to try and experiment with because it feeds on itself so
3:47:42
I I wouldn't want the job of of trying to correct what's going
3:47:49
on in revenue in the expenditures of the United States with roughly a 7% gap when
3:47:57
probably a 3% gap is sustainable and then the further away you get from that
3:48:03
the more you get to where the uncontrollable begins
3:48:08
and Uh
3:48:13
I well I I think that it's it's a job I
3:48:19
don't want but it's a job I think should be done and Congress does not seem good
3:48:24
at doing
3:48:34
it well it sounds like you should quit while I'm ahead
3:48:42
it it's it's and well we've got a lot of
3:48:47
problems always as a country but but this is one we bring on ourselves i
3:48:53
mean it it we have a revenue stream a capital producing
3:49:00
stream a brains producing machine like the world has never seen
3:49:07
and if you picked a way to screw it up it would involve the currency and and
3:49:14
that's happened a lot of places and and the
3:49:21
incentives plus the checks uh well there aren't any there
3:49:27
aren't any real checks you got in theory you would make it so there was substantial downside for the anybody
3:49:33
that screwed things up but but there isn't downside there's upside and so it
3:49:41
uh it's the the problem of the most successful company in the history of the
3:49:48
country in the history of the world and uh at this point we got a little room to
3:49:55
go in in solving and then with that I'll shut up and go on to station three
3:50:06
hello Mr buffett my name is Saskia from Gon Germany and first of all I want to
3:50:13
thank you because you made such a great impact in my life and the life the
3:50:20
people I love and that's priceless well thank you
3:50:28
Mr buffett imagine it's 1776 and you're sitting alongside
3:50:34
Benjamin Franklin helping to shape the foundation of a new
3:50:40
nation what core economic principles would you advocate for building a far
3:50:48
fair resilient and opportunitydriven capitalism society
3:50:54
one that supports longtime prosperity for future generations
3:51:00
well I I probably that's a good question but I would probably say to Ben Franklin
3:51:06
you just keep thinking and don't talk to me because you'll you'll come up with some better ideas than I will he was you
3:51:13
know incredibly remarkable person i mean that he would say he's
3:51:19
almost probably the last person to almost have a grasp of every every
3:51:24
aspect of of uh of activity in the country he he invented
3:51:32
all kinds of things and he incidentally we were talking about
3:51:39
uh power of compound interest and that sort of thing he he left a will that
3:51:44
that left a sum of money to Philadelphia and another sum to Boston that would
3:51:51
serve as a example for a couple hundred years you know of the power of compounding and all all kinds of things
3:51:58
i he he was so far ahead of his time that that the best thing I could do if I
3:52:03
was under that tree with him was be to to get out get out of his way and let him just
3:52:11
keep thinking uh but uh it
3:52:17
it he saw the problems that
3:52:23
success could bring to a society as well as other problems i mean more immediate
3:52:31
problems that that uh uh in all kinds of
3:52:36
fields but the problems of how how to cause how
3:52:44
to take 8 billion people because there's no way we can separate ourselves from the rest of the
3:52:50
world we can be example to the rest of the world and I think it it behooves
3:52:57
us since we have had all this good fortune in this country and we do have a
3:53:02
pretty good system i don't think it I don't think you get I don't think you get very far by lecturing the world on
3:53:09
how you're the the one that you tell them what they
3:53:14
should do with our lives i think I I think you get a certain amount of resentment when just a few hundred years
3:53:22
ago uh a whole different group of countries were running the world and and now you
3:53:29
start giving them advice and that I I think it's a it's a real mistake in
3:53:35
communication or in persuasion to uh to lecture a bunch of
3:53:42
people who you've just won the game i mean that's uh but anyway
3:53:48
uh I I would say that I would advise Ben to figure out
3:53:54
how to win the game and keep a certain amount of humility at the same time and
3:54:00
uh I would tell him to try and design a system that doesn't invent too many
3:54:05
things that can destroy the planet uh you know that become
3:54:13
uncontrollable once you get them out there there was no alternative to us
3:54:19
developing the atom bomb but but but the expansion of the number of
3:54:26
people that have the ability from one to eight and and nine probably pretty soon
3:54:34
with Iran i mean that that's a mistake that society just
3:54:40
could not afford to make i mean solving the problem with nine variables instead
3:54:45
of simply one now it's totally understandable my dad was in Congress
3:54:51
when when the atom bomb was uh first used it's amazing
3:54:58
how how uh uh Sam Raburn kept the House of Representatives uninformed because they
3:55:05
they're supposed to appropriate all the money and had 435 congressmen there and
3:55:11
they had no idea they were appropriating money for for uh Los Alamos or what was
3:55:18
going on in Chicago or what was going on in at uh Tennessee but anyway uh
3:55:26
uh we we we do have a society
3:55:34
that is far beyond anything that Ben Franklin dreamt
3:55:40
of it's achieved some of the or is achieve it's moving toward in the right
3:55:47
direction toward solving some problems where we made kind of broad declarations
3:55:53
about all men being created equal and and etc and then we did some of the
3:55:58
things we did but generally speaking we moved in the right direction
3:56:04
uh but we face problems that I don't know what how how Ben Franklin would
3:56:11
would uh uh attack the problem of of what you do
3:56:18
once you get weapons of mass destruction in many
3:56:24
hands and when you essentially look at the
3:56:31
world as something where there are winners and
3:56:36
losers and that the winners are you know humiliate the losers and do
3:56:42
all kinds of things i it but I'll I'll let the people are a lot younger to figure out the answers on
3:56:49
that but it's it's still the most wonderful there's never been anything
3:56:55
you could dream like what has happened in the United States so we still it's
3:57:01
it's the best place and the best time to be alive by by miles in the
3:57:08
street just think of a couple hundred years ago and somebody you know yanking out a few
3:57:15
of your teeth and pouring whiskey down you doing i mean the subsistence and and
3:57:21
particularly in this Midwest just imagine waiting till the Missouri froze over every year just to see whether you
3:57:26
can get your wagon across and maybe have a pregnant woman in the back you know
3:57:32
when who it is just amazing what has happened of a positive nature during my
3:57:39
lifetime and then the question is is how do you how do you keep it and how do you improve it and uh
3:57:48
uh I I I do think that fundamental to all of it though is having a uh is
3:57:56
having a currency that that does not get debased what that does to
3:58:01
the stability of a society where all the people that trust
3:58:07
their government get screwed and all the people that figure out ways to profit off of it
3:58:14
become rich or richer i I I I don't think you want a
3:58:19
society that operates in that manner so anyway
3:58:31
Let's see that was section three so we're going to
3:58:37
Becky is that right yep that's right um Greg this question is for you it comes from a shareholder named Jay Milroy
3:58:45
uh who writes "Mr buffett has a hands-off approach to managing the operating subsidiaries how would you
3:58:52
describe your approach?"
3:58:59
better well we've got our managers over there and it I I would say going back to 2018 it's been a it's been very
3:59:07
fortunate to be in this role because one I had to learn a lot of the businesses
3:59:13
and there's no question as uh Warren bought the businesses had that general
3:59:18
knowledge i absolutely had to engage with each of them and they've been great in uh sharing their their business
3:59:26
models their approach their thoughts around where the risks and opportunities are and I think as we went through that
3:59:34
there's no question um I had questions and wanted to engage with them and
3:59:40
Warren talks about the curiosity being important as you go through things that would be my style to have questions and
3:59:47
comments around their business their frameworks um at the same time they have
3:59:52
great businesses and and they run them very autonomously and that that remains in place but if there's opportunities to
4:00:00
see where uh maybe seen something in another business or an opportunity I may
4:00:06
see in their industry we're going to discuss it and see if that's uh something we should pursue or are we
4:00:12
properly addressing the risk and I found all our managers to be absolutely engaging on that and and and want to
4:00:19
have those dialogues and I'd say that's a reflection of of my approach i'd also
4:00:25
say that um when you think of our managers again very autonomous they they
4:00:32
run their businesses they know it better than I ever will but if I see an
4:00:37
opportunity that it's well worth their time to talk to another one of our managers if it's Geico and they've gone
4:00:45
through a technology transformation um they're not by themselves that need
4:00:51
to be thinking that way we want to make sure the right folks are talking and
4:00:56
figuring out how we can benefit from the prior experiences so it's um I would say
4:01:04
more active uh but it hopefully in a very positive way and they and we got an exceptional
4:01:10
group so it's worked out exceptionally well as uh as I've gone through that period of time it's working way better
4:01:16
with Greg than with me because uh you know I I just um I didn't want to
4:01:25
work as hard as he worked and and and I could get away with it because uh we've
4:01:31
got a basically good business very good business and uh and I wasn't in danger
4:01:37
of you firing me by virtue of both ownership and the fact that we would do pretty well uh but uh the fact that you
4:01:45
can do pretty well doesn't mean you couldn't do better and and and Greg can do better at many things many people
4:01:53
want to be managed need help in being managed some don't some you just leave
4:01:59
alone uh you know we've had managers it would have been crazy to
4:02:07
uh started giving instructions to cuz they just quit and and I wouldn't blame
4:02:12
him cuz I'd be the same type myself but uh a lot of people I mean people really
4:02:21
do welcome direction and help and and and uh you know and particularly when
4:02:27
they're getting it from somebody like Greg that really lives the life himself and doesn't just come down on from a
4:02:33
high and say you know here's what you do while I do something else you know and a
4:02:41
manager that behaves differently than than what he's asking asking
4:02:46
uh the people beneath them to behave it it's it just doesn't work over time and
4:02:54
uh people want a manager that they that they admire and they're not
4:03:01
going to admire them if those people profess to behave in one manner
4:03:07
and behave in another manner it's easier this is a sad thing but it's it's easier
4:03:14
for an organization to see its quality move downward than it is upward
4:03:22
i mean it it if if the boss behaves badly
4:03:27
uh it causes everybody to to behave i mean it it it that is
4:03:34
really catching it's not as a c catching on the way in upper management
4:03:41
but if the manager is doing a lot of little things
4:03:47
to grease his own situation pretty soon let's say you're
4:03:54
running a retail establishment pretty soon all the employees are a lot of the employees are
4:04:04
telling their friends that they they get a discount you know with the retail operation and if they want they want if
4:04:12
their friend wants something they'll put it on their account and then get the discount what once you start deviating
4:04:19
downward it is really contagious and it is hard to rebuild so
4:04:25
you really need someone that that uh behaves well on top and is not
4:04:34
playing games for their own benefit and and we get a lot of managers that bend
4:04:40
over backwards not to do that sort of thing and then we get a few that bend over
4:04:46
forwards and uh and if you get enough companies you're going to get a lot of
4:04:51
different forms of behavior and Greg does something about it and I I've
4:04:56
generally been laxed in doing something about it but he's done a way better job at that than I
4:05:02
have
4:05:09
okay station four hello Mr buffett and Mr ael my name
4:05:18
is Kansas Lomire i am a junior at Elkrin South High School and was born and
4:05:23
raised in Omaha my question is directed to Greg Ael birkshshire Hathaway is the
4:05:29
second largest utility provider in the United States and a 2025 Reuters
4:05:35
investigation found that is the coal fleet is the dirtiest in the nation
4:05:41
there is currently no concrete plans to retire coal and fully transition to
4:05:47
renewable energy i'm 17 years old considering that what do you have to say
4:05:54
to young people like me who will live with the consequences of climate change
4:05:59
con by companies like Birkshshire [Music] [Applause]
4:06:11
thank you for your your your both your question and your comments because it is it is important to to understand uh say
4:06:20
Berkshire Hathway Energy but also um how they operate and and maybe using Iowa at
4:06:28
least as a starting example because I think that was one of the uh states
4:06:33
cited in the report one of the important things that I'd say
4:06:38
early in us acquiring our energy companies and I go back to when we
4:06:45
acquired Mid American we acquired it in uh 1999 berkshire purchased uh Mid-Americ
4:06:52
in 2000 well one thing that became very clear to uh myself and our teams was
4:06:58
that what we do within our utilities is really driven in two fronts one we
4:07:05
absolutely have to meet the requirements and the law that's laid out federally
4:07:10
but most importantly we had to recognize we implement public policy across these
4:07:17
states and that was an interesting conversation when I go back to to Iowa
4:07:23
and again the report cited that as a a significant problem um it was early in
4:07:29
the 2000s when for the first time in Iowa we were going to as a utility be
4:07:36
short of power so we didn't have the energy and we entered into a a significant discussion with our governor
4:07:43
at the time and and really sat down and said "Where do you want us to go as uh
4:07:50
as Mid-American and what resources do you want as as a state?" And at that time we
4:07:59
were predominantly a coal based state um
4:08:04
and and we recognized that uh obviously and and fundamentally personally viewed
4:08:11
it as a risk but we we needed to have that conversation with our state and as to how we would manage that going
4:08:18
forward the interesting thing was that um as we had that conversation in uh the
4:08:25
early 2000s again with the leadership of our state it was clearly decided we
4:08:31
wanted to continue to be long power so i.e not be short for our customers we
4:08:37
discussed the type of resource and I I remember uh a very clear conversation
4:08:42
around we wanted to stay balanced across a variety of energy sources and and at
4:08:48
that time it was really coal and natural gas and at that time we made the
4:08:54
decision to build the largest uh wind project in the in the US in Iowa so we
4:09:03
undertook an effort to build three resources a a coal plant a gas plant and
4:09:08
a uh what was the first uh wind project we owned in
4:09:15
Mid-Americ and again it was very consistent with what the state wanted
4:09:21
but we also laid some important groundwork there because we started to define the importance of uh renewable
4:09:28
energy non-carbon resources but it has to be consistent with what the state wanted and we've gone on over the since
4:09:36
that period of time um to deploy $16
4:09:42
billion into Iowa associated with renewable energy again very consistent
4:09:50
with what our state wanted us to do i.e the underlying policy we don't get to make that decision and just spend 16
4:09:57
billion uh it's done in conjunction with our governors our legislators our
4:10:03
regulators and at the same time um we've had the opportunity to retire
4:10:10
five of the 10 coal units now as the report highlighted I I understand people
4:10:17
would like those other five coal units retired at this time but to think we
4:10:23
deployed 16 billion to retire five and and it's a very good outcome for our
4:10:29
customers we've been able to maintain our rates they're the some of the lowest in the country so it's been done very
4:10:37
efficiently but the reality is we still need those five coal units to keep the
4:10:42
system stable uh we cannot have a Spain Portugal
4:10:57
situation so we absolutely respect the input we absolutely respect the process
4:11:05
and will continue to work with each of our states to identify the path they
4:11:10
would like to chart and we work hard to ensure there's good balanced outcomes
4:11:16
because we recognize uh um the challenges they're associated with um
4:11:22
others other folks desires so I think you'll continue to see our utilities implement policy consistent with uh with
4:11:31
the needs of of their stakeholders their customers and at the same time always respecting what uh what's required by
4:11:38
any any of the federal standards so thank you for your for your comments
4:11:53
okay 31 let's see becky uh this question
4:11:58
comes from Billy D ross he writes "Mr buffett as a nurse from New York State I've spent years struggling to secure
4:12:05
good health insurance for myself even while working on the front lines to save lives in New York accessing insurance
4:12:12
means navigating a confusing state-run system that feels like it's designed to overwhelm i'm curious what ultimately
4:12:20
led to the end of your healthc care venture with JP Morgan and Amazon and given your commitment to value and
4:12:26
long-term thinking would you ever consider taking another look at health insurance reform in the US yeah
4:12:33
we're we're spending close it's hard to get the precise figure but close to 20% of
4:12:41
GDP on health and if you go back to 1960 there were a
4:12:48
number of countries that were each spending around 5% and uh then they the lines began to
4:12:57
diverge dramatically but the mathematical
4:13:02
uh fact that there are only 100 percentage points in in the equation didn't change
4:13:10
so uh we tried that
4:13:15
uh experiment with JP Morgan and Amazon and uh we had three people
4:13:24
that didn't think they knew the answer and uh but thought
4:13:30
that in my case I use the term that that it was a tapeworm in the
4:13:37
economy and We also found out that uh that the
4:13:44
tapeworm was alive in every in every part of the country i mean the the
4:13:49
hospitals liked it the hospitals had prominent people working with
4:13:55
people people generally liked their doctor didn't like the but didn't like the system i mean all kinds of things
4:14:01
but in the end uh JP Morgan and Amazon and Bergkshire
4:14:08
were not going to have any effect on changing that 20% now that
4:14:13
20% there are only 100 percentage points uh available and one other countries
4:14:23
spend six or 7% and perhaps use our system to their advantage which is well
4:14:30
also very true uh you know that is an enormous
4:14:35
percentage of of an economy and uh we
4:14:42
simply it was too entrenched uh to really do much in the way of
4:14:49
change and uh we spent some money on it and we did
4:14:54
some work and we learned a good bit about our own systems and we saw
4:15:00
the degree to which the present system was
4:15:07
ingrained in so many people's you know whether the health
4:15:13
care providers whether everybody and these aren't evil people I mean they're just they're just going about something
4:15:20
and trying to trying to save lives but but uh we found that whether it was in
4:15:27
Canada or France or Britain or wherever it might be that if you looked at our
4:15:32
costs that they were just far higher and to some extent we were subsidizing
4:15:38
the rest of the world and people would come to the United States to do the
4:15:47
really unusual or challenging uh aspects health in terms of operations
4:15:55
and that sort of thing uh but we we made no progress and uh
4:16:03
uh there comes a point where the government's you know and I
4:16:10
mean it's so involved in the situation and health is so important to most to everybody and uh
4:16:19
uh we couldn't we we uh we as
4:16:24
I said to uh Jamie and Jeff I said well the tapeworm won and uh uh there are
4:16:34
problems of society when you get 20% of your
4:16:40
GDP going into a given industry
4:16:46
the the degree of enthusiasm for changing that industry
4:16:52
the political power that the industry will have and that doesn't mean they're evil it's and And you know everybody
4:16:58
they just end up there and uh uh so I don't know the
4:17:04
uh I we we came to the conclusion we didn't know the answer three of us and
4:17:10
uh uh we had the money to do it and we didn't
4:17:19
know how to change how 330 million people felt about
4:17:25
their doctor felt about our healthc care what they felt entitled to and you know and it's
4:17:32
uh it it it won't change by itself and
4:17:39
uh government is the only one that can change it and the only people in
4:17:44
government that can change it are getting majority of 435 people and 100
4:17:49
people and and my dad lost one election in his life in 1948 8 and he he he was a
4:17:59
very strong Republican and in 1950 he went back and
4:18:04
beat the guy that beat him in 1948 and he got the doctors behind him and and uh
4:18:11
uh he did very you know they're very well and they believe 100% in what
4:18:16
they're doing they're helping people every day and during the pandemic the sacrifices made by
4:18:23
people save other people just incredible can you imagine working in in
4:18:29
something where they're bringing in people that are you know going to die by the dozens and dozens and dozens and you
4:18:36
try to somehow keep your own morale up and keep working with them so you can't
4:18:41
argue about the importance of it but our costs are so different than any c
4:18:48
country in the world that it's a it is just it's a huge element and we're a
4:18:54
very rich country so we can do other we can do things other countries can't do
4:19:00
and through our elected representatives and a whole variety of things over time
4:19:05
we've developed a system that is
4:19:11
enormously resistant to any kind of major major change and
4:19:17
it's important in every community that it's in so I wish we had an answer for you but but uh uh I was somewhat
4:19:27
pessimistic going in i was a little more pessimistic when we came out but I'm I'm glad I'm glad we did what we did and and
4:19:34
we learned something about our own failings uh in the process so Berkshire in
4:19:40
effect got us money's worth but we didn't kill the
4:19:46
tapeworm okay trying to change things in government is
4:19:52
it's an interesting proposition in the country because uh uh you get self-
4:19:59
selection in terms of the people that go into government and continue in it and
4:20:05
to some extent they keep they have to make decisions that they don't like as they
4:20:12
go along and they learn to accept them or or rationalize them or whatever
4:20:18
whatever it may be but it's still the best you know this country's worked out better than any country in the world so
4:20:24
it uh you you can't argue it was a failure
4:20:30
but you can argue that there is that there are certain problems that are
4:20:35
terribly tough to figure out ways to solve and of course one of them gets
4:20:42
back to the fiscal problem I mentioned before because it's it's easy to spend
4:20:47
money and it's hard to cut people's receipts and uh and if you get
4:20:53
elected you know you are going to you're going to say to yourself well I can do
4:20:59
more good if I stay and then if I really vote my conscience on this sort of thing
4:21:04
so you give away a little bit here and a little bit there and a little bit there and finally you don't recognize yourself
4:21:09
in the mirror anymore and and uh that's
4:21:15
I grew up in a political family but but uh and I watched I watched how people behaved and
4:21:22
and and they behave like human beings which is what you have to expect and I
4:21:27
behave like human beings um uh we still manage to keep moving
4:21:35
forward in dramatic way it's so much better to live here than it was 100 years ago or 200 years ago it's dramatic
4:21:42
so you can't say the system's a failure but you can say that it is very difficult to
4:21:48
make major changes in it
4:21:54
okay station five
4:21:59
hi Warren Gu my name is Pig Huang Chen i'm from Taiwan this is my seventh time
4:22:05
here first of all I want to thank you Warren for your generosity of sharing your wisdom and lesson you changed my
4:22:13
life and you are my role model and my hero and my question is Warren you
4:22:19
mentioned that Mr apple will be in charge of capital allocation near the future and I'd like to know your
4:22:26
perspective on is it easier for business operator to be an investor or for
4:22:33
investor to be a business operator thank you no that's a good question i see we
4:22:39
call him Mr apple even thank you and I'll take it and uh
4:22:48
uh it's a lot tougher to be an operator i mean it it is it's easier to sit in a
4:22:55
room like I do and play around with money uh it's just an easier life uh that
4:23:03
doesn't mean it's a more admirable life it doesn't but it's been actually been a
4:23:09
pleasant life for me so I I don't complain to the least and and I and
4:23:15
I've I've been able to choose my friends which has made an enormous
4:23:24
uh difference in my life i've never had to work for anybody that I really didn't
4:23:30
admire i mean that's a luxury in life had five different people I worked for
4:23:37
and uh you know I just they were fantastic
4:23:43
whether it was with the manager of the local pennies which is located well it
4:23:48
used to be located a couple miles from here and uh newspaper managers everything they
4:23:56
have never been really disappointed by any teacher I've had so
4:24:02
uh but I would I have to admit that that uh I have been able
4:24:09
to choose what I do with my day to an extraordinary degree compared
4:24:16
to to be a business operator and and in
4:24:22
many cases uh I wouldn't like to
4:24:28
compete to be a top-notch business operator in terms of some of
4:24:35
some of the some of the behavior that would might be forced upon me i I am the master i mean I'm I' I've found myself
4:24:43
in this position where I can I can run the kind of company I want to run and
4:24:49
and that that that's an extraordinary luxury and with it with that I should
4:24:54
say that I'm getting a a section that says five minute warning exclamation point five minute
4:25:00
warning exclamation point so I would now like to turn to a subject that I want to
4:25:08
discuss with you a few minutes and then when I'm through discussing this I'll let Becky ask me a question or two which
4:25:17
may want you may want some elaborate questions that come to you as I I make
4:25:24
these comments uh tomorrow we're having a board meeting of
4:25:33
Bergkshire and uh we have 11 directors two of the directors who are
4:25:41
my children uh Howie and Susie know of what I'm
4:25:46
going to talk about there the rest of them this will come as news to uh but I
4:25:52
think it it's uh the time has arrived
4:25:58
where Greg should become the chief executive
4:26:03
officer of the company at your end and I want to spring that on the directors
4:26:10
effectively and give that as my recommendation let them have the time to
4:26:15
think about what questions or what structures or anything that they want
4:26:21
and then the meeting following that uh which will come in a few months uh
4:26:29
we'll take action on whatever the view is of the 11
4:26:36
directors uh I I think they'll be unanimously in favor of it And
4:26:44
uh that would mean that at year end Greg would be the chief executive or officer
4:26:53
of Bergkshire and uh um I would still
4:26:58
hang around and could conceivably be useful in a few cases that's good but
4:27:04
the final word would be what Greg said in
4:27:12
operations in capital deployment whatever it might be i could be helpful
4:27:19
I believe in that in certain respects if
4:27:24
we ran into periods of great opportunity or anything
4:27:29
uh I I I think that Ber has a special reputation that
4:27:36
when there's times of trouble for the government that we are an asset and not a liability which is a position that
4:27:45
very hard to have because usually the the um the public and and and and government
4:27:53
get very negative on on business if there's a time like that but so I think
4:27:58
I could there might be a time when I I'd be hopeful but Greg would have the
4:28:04
tickets and uh uh and he would make like
4:28:09
I said whether it's acquisitions uh I think the board would
4:28:15
be more welcome to giving him more authority on large acquisitions probably if they knew
4:28:22
I was around uh but Kate would be the chief executive period and uh like I say
4:28:31
the plan is to u and Greg doesn't know anything about this
4:28:36
until what he's hearing right now but that uh yeah the uh
4:28:46
uh the the board
4:28:51
will be able ask me questions tomorrow as to a little more of the
4:28:58
specifics of of what they should be thinking and all that they they'll
4:29:04
they'll they'll they'll digest it and then at the next board meeting after
4:29:10
that uh if we as I would guess we would if
4:29:16
they act then obviously we we have something to announce to the world as a
4:29:24
material change and perure and we'll go forward with that operation and and
4:29:30
uh Uh I will play with a Ouija board or whatever and that comes out in terms of
4:29:38
doing things but but I will not I have no intention
4:29:46
zero of selling one share of Ber halfway
4:29:52
get given away gradually
4:30:07
It it just won't [Music]
4:30:38
Hey thank you
4:31:18
hello i
4:31:40
Okay drink your coke and calm down
4:31:51
i would I would say I would add this the uh the decision to keep every
4:31:57
share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Bure will be
4:32:02
better under Greg's management than than mine and and uh
4:32:08
uh but you know I will I will come in and and uh and there may come a time
4:32:17
when we get a chance to invest a lot of money and and uh and if that time
4:32:23
comes I think it may be helpful with the board the fact that they know I've got
4:32:29
all my money in the in the company and that that I think it's smart and I've
4:32:35
seen what Greg has done so uh that's the news hook for the day
4:32:42
fell and thanks for coming yeah heat
4:33:15
yeah the in the the enthusiasm shown by that response
4:33:23
could be interpreted in two ways but I'll take a surprise thank you sir yep
4:33:44
okay heat
